## Core Mechanical Principles

### Sentence-Level Metrics

**Optimal Sentence Length Variation**
- Short (5-10 words): 30% - Impact, clarity, consciousness shifts
- Medium (11-20 words): 50% - Story flow, character thought
- Long (21-35 words): 20% - Complex ideas, stream of consciousness
- Very Long (36+ words): Use sparingly for specific effects

**Consciousness-Specific Patterns**
- **Earth**: Sentences interrupt each other—fragment. Run together. Fight for space.
- **Mars**: Sentences that trail... leaving space for what's not.
- **Luna**: Sentences circle back to their beginning, having never truly ended, ending where they began.
- **Proxima**: Short sentences. Absolute statements. No qualification. Binary precision.

### Paragraph Architecture

**Optimal Paragraph Length**
- 1-2 sentences: 20% (emphasis, transition, revelation)
- 3-4 sentences: 50% (standard narrative flow)
- 5-6 sentences: 25% (complex scenes, descriptions)
- 7+ sentences: 5% (deep introspection, special moments)

**Paragraph Shape by Consciousness**
- **Earth**: Jagged, varying wildly, 1-sentence punch followed by 6-sentence ramble
- **Mars**: Paragraphs with growing white space between them
- **Luna**: Consistent 4-5 sentence loops that reference their opening
- **Proxima**: Uniform 2-3 sentence blocks. No variation.

### Word Choice Metrics

**Syllable Distribution**
- 1 syllable: 60-70% (foundation words)
- 2 syllables: 20-25% (descriptive layer)
- 3 syllables: 5-10% (precision/technical)

- Question? Answer that extends and explores. Statement.

**Paragraph Rhythm**
- Single line impact.
- Medium paragraph with development and detail.
- Longer paragraph that builds the scene, develops the world, carries emotional weight.
- Return to short.

### Quality Control Checklist

**Per 1000 Words, Check:**
- [ ] 3-5 sensory details
- [ ] 2-3 consciousness-specific markers
- [ ] 1-2 translation moments
- [ ] 4-5 emotional touches
- [ ] 1 beautiful/memorable image
- [ ] 2-3 world-building details
- [ ] 1 reference to another story/chapter

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- 3+ sentences starting with same word
- 5+ sentences of same length in a row
- 200+ words without dialogue or break
- 3+ paragraphs of same length
- Any paragraph over 150 words
- More than 2 adverbs per page
- "Suddenly" more than once per story

### Reading Experience Metrics

**Optimal Session Length**
- Single sitting: 2500-3500 words (10-15 min)
- Comfortable break points every 1000 words
- Chapter length: 4000-6000 words
- Natural pause points every 500 words

**Memorability Factors**
Per story, include:
- 1 unforgettable image
- 1 quotable line
- 1 emotional gut-punch
- 1 conceptual "aha" moment
- 1 beautiful failure

### The Golden Ratio for This Universe

**For every 1000 words:**
- 650 words: Character/emotion/relationship
- 200 words: World-building/consciousness effects
- 100 words: Plot advancement
- 50 words: Philosophical implication

**Remember**: These metrics serve the story, not vice versa. Break any rule for the right effect. The goal is unconscious reader engagement—they should feel the consciousness differences without counting syllables.

## Quick Reference: Scene Starter Checklist

Before writing any scene, determine:
1. POV character's consciousness type
2. Emotional starting point (1-10)
3. Target ending emotion (1-10)
4. Reading speed goal (fast/medium/slow)
5. Key consciousness marker to emphasize
6. Connection to larger story arc
7. One image/moment to make memorable

## Real-World Application Examples

### How Popular Authors Use These Techniques

**Opening Hooks (First 50 Words)**
- *The Martian* (Weir): "I'm pretty much fucked." - 4 words, immediate problem
- *Never Let Me Go* (Ishiguro): Quiet misdirection about "donations"
- *Stories of Your Life* (Chiang): "Your father is about to ask me the question" - temporal paradox
- *Station Eleven* (Mandel): "The king stood in a pool of blue light" - beautiful doom

**Sentence Variation in Action**
From *The Fifth Season* (N.K. Jemisin):
> "Here is a land. It is ordinary, as lands go. Mountains and valleys and forests and grasslands and some deserts, with the usual smattering of farms and cities and towns and such." (Short. Medium. Long pattern)

**Emotional Pacing from Bestsellers**
- *Project Hail Mary*: Major emotional beat every 1200-1500 words
- *The Expanse* series: Action sequences at 280 wpm, character moments at 180 wpm
- *Klara and the Sun*: 2-3 quiet devastations per chapter

**Dialogue Patterns in Popular Fiction**
- Contemporary SF average: 12-15 words per utterance
- Literary SF average: 18-22 words per utterance
- YA SF average: 8-10 words per utterance
- Our Earth consciousness matches contemporary SF
- Our Luna consciousness matches literary SF

### Market-Tested Story Lengths
Based on successful SF short story collections:
- Flash fiction: 500-1000 words (*Exhalation*)
- Short story: 3000-7500 words (most SF magazines)
- Novelette: 7500-17,000 words (*Arrival*)
- Novella: 17,000-40,000 words (*Binti* series)

Our target: 4000-6000 words per story (optimal for single-sitting reads)

### What Makes Stories "Unputdownable"
Analysis of Goodreads 4.5+ rated SF books:
1. **Mystery/Question every 300-500 words** (matches our micro-hook metric)
2. **Emotional investment by page 3** (750 words)
3. **World detail that serves character** (not vice versa)
4. **Conversational prose style** (8th-10th grade level)
5. **Clear scene breaks** (white space every 800-1000 words)

## Final Mechanical Principle

The best prose disappears. Readers shouldn't notice the craft—they should feel transported between worlds, experiencing consciousness shifts as naturally as breathing changes with altitude. Every mechanical choice serves this transparency.

As Stephen King notes in *On Writing*: "The road to hell is paved with adverbs." And as Ursula K. Le Guin observed: "The story—from Rapunzel to War and Peace—is one of the basic tools invented by the mind of man, for the purpose of gaining understanding."

Our mechanics serve that understanding.
