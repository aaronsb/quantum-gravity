<h1 id="love-across-gravity">Love Across Gravity</h1>
<p>Ten years was both forever and nothing, depending on which consciousness counted.</p>
<p>Sarah had kept a journal for the first three years, documenting their translation failures like a scientist cataloging specimens. The fight about furniture arrangement that wasn't really about furniture but about whether space should flow (Earth) or simply be (Luna). The silent dinners when Magnus would forget that silence meant anger on Earth, not contentment. The night she'd sobbed in the bathroom after he'd described their future in past tense, making her feel like she'd already died.</p>
<p>Year four brought the fertility struggles—Earth doctors baffled by their incompatible biorhythms, Luna specialists suggesting patience Sarah didn't have. She'd wanted a baby with Earth-urgency that felt like walls closing in. He'd experienced their childlessness as a state that would resolve when it resolved, which only made her urgency sharper. The treatments failed. The marriage counselor quit. Then, inexplicably, pregnancy. Not through science but through what Magnus called "the inevitable accident of proximity"—two consciousnesses colliding often enough that life found a way.</p>
<p>Luna's birth had broken something in both of them. Not bad-broken. Broken like light through a prism, revealing frequencies neither parent could see alone. Their daughter spoke her first word at thirteen months: "between." Not mama, not papa. Between. The pediatrician said it was babbling. Sarah and Magnus knew better.</p>
<p>Now, Sarah and Magnus's tenth anniversary arrived like everything in their marriage—at different speeds for each of them.</p>
<p>She woke Earth-quick, already thinking of the restaurant reservation, the gift hidden in her closet, the babysitter for Luna who'd need specific instructions about their daughter's peculiar patience. Anniversary meant event. Meant marking time. Meant celebration of duration.</p>
<p>Magnus woke slowly, his body still adjusting to Earth rhythms even after all these years. For him, their anniversary felt less like an event and more like a continuation—another layer in the structure they'd built together.</p>
<p>"Happy anniversary," Sarah said, kissing him Earth-quick.</p>
<p>He caught her face between his hands, held her with Luna-patience until the kiss became something else. Not Earth-urgent or Luna-eternal but the frequency they'd found between them. The compromise of touch when words had failed.</p>
<p>"Anniversary," he repeated, pulling her back down beside him. "Ten years. Sometimes feels like yesterday, sometimes like a lifetime."</p>
<p>Their daughter Luna appeared in the doorway, already seven though Sarah could swear she was just born yesterday while Magnus insisted she'd always been seven, would always be seven in the eternal now of his perception. Born between worlds, speaking neither Earth nor Luna but something new.</p>
<p>The international school had given up trying to classify her. Not a learning disability, not giftedness, not autism—something unmapped. She read books backwards and forwards simultaneously. Drew pictures that only made sense from multiple angles. Had friends who didn't mind that she sometimes spoke in future tense about present events. The other between-consciousness children found her at recess like iron filings to a magnet, forming their own gravity well of incomprehension.</p>
<p>"Today is the day," she said. Not question, not statement. Something between.</p>
<p>"Yes, baby," Sarah said. "Mama and Papa's special day."</p>
<p>"All days are special." Luna moved into the room with inherited patience. "But this one has a name."</p>
<p>Magnus lifted her, settled her between them. Their trilingual family—Earth, Luna, and whatever Luna was becoming. The translators had given up on their household years ago. Too many frequencies intersecting.</p>
<p>"Tell us a story," Luna requested. Their morning ritual.</p>
<p>Sarah began Earth-style: "Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved a boy across impossible distance—"</p>
<p>"No time," Luna corrected gently. "Stories don't have time."</p>
<p>Magnus continued, his architect's mind building the story like a blueprint: "There is a girl who loves a boy even when they see time differently. The distance between them stays constant, but they find ways to bridge it."</p>
<p>"No distance," Luna said. "Love doesn't have distance."</p>
<p>They looked at their daughter. Seven years old and already untranslatable. Her consciousness wasn't Earth or Luna or even between. It was beyond. Past the edges of what they'd thought possible.</p>
<p>"Then you tell it," Sarah said.</p>
<p>Luna settled back, found words in her impossible language: "Love is. People are. Between is. The end."</p>
<p>Four sentences that held their entire marriage. Sarah laughed—Earth-bright. Magnus smiled—Luna-deep. Luna hummed—something neither parent could name.</p>
<p>Their Jordaan townhouse had evolved its own geography over the years. Sarah's office on the ground floor, Earth-accessible, with lists and schedules covering every wall. Magnus's workshop in the attic, where he designed structures that existed in continuous time, buildings that remembered their future renovations. Luna's room between them, neither up nor down but somehow sideways, painted in colors that changed depending on when you looked.</p>
<p>Later, at breakfast, the translation failures multiplied:</p>
<p>"Pass the—" Sarah gestured at the jam.</p>
<p>"The strawberry jam," Magnus said, then smiled at his own mental slip. "Sorry—I was thinking about the preservation process. Architect brain."</p>
<p>"Strawberries aren't patient," Luna observed.</p>
<p>"Earth strawberries aren't," Magnus agreed. "But the concept of preserved sweetness—"</p>
<p>"It's just jam," Sarah said, spreading it Earth-quick on toast.</p>
<p>"Nothing is just," Luna said.</p>
<p>By noon, Sarah felt the familiar anniversary tension. Ten years of trying to celebrate across consciousness gaps. Ten years of presents that didn't translate, dinners where they sat at the same table in different timestreams, toasts that meant celebration to her and presence to him.</p>
<p>She remembered their first anniversary—she'd planned an elaborate surprise party with Earth friends. Magnus had walked in, seen the crowd, and gone completely still. Not upset, just... overwhelmed by the sudden multiplicity of present moments. He'd spent the evening experiencing each conversation as eternal, while guests grew increasingly uncomfortable with his geological responses to small talk. They'd learned to celebrate privately after that.</p>
<p>"I have a gift," she told Magnus while Luna napped.</p>
<p>"Oh?" he said, looking pleased but slightly confused. "I thought we weren't doing gifts this year. Or did I misremember?"</p>
<p>She gave him the watch. Expensive. Engraved. A Earth-symbol of time marked and measured.</p>
<p>He held it like he held everything—completely. Then set it aside and pulled her close.</p>
<p>"I have a gift too," he said.</p>
<p>She waited. He was still. The moment stretched, Luna-long.</p>
<p>"This," he finally said.</p>
<p>"This what?"</p>
<p>"This. Now. Us. The gift is the anniversary itself." He touched her face. "Ten years Earth-time. Eternity Luna-time. Both. Neither. The space between where we live."</p>
<p>"That's not a gift. That's just... life."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>She wanted to be frustrated. Wanted to demand something concrete, Earth-real. But looking at him—at them—at their impossible marriage that worked despite not working...</p>
<p>"I don't understand you," she said.</p>
<p>"I don't understand you," he agreed.</p>
<p>"But I love you."</p>
<p>"But I love you."</p>
<p>Luna wandered in, trailing her afternoon nap like a blanket. "Are you fighting?"</p>
<p>"No, baby."</p>
<p>"Yes," Magnus said simultaneously.</p>
<p>Luna nodded. "Fighting-loving. Like when I speak and you don't hear but you listen anyway."</p>
<p>Out of the mouths of between-world babes.</p>
<p>That evening, they went to dinner. The restaurant was Earth-fancy, courses timed and presented with urgency. Sarah had chosen it carefully—a place that understood their family's peculiar needs. The waiter, Brazilian with off-world experience, didn't blink when Magnus ordered by describing the emotional resonance of flavors rather than their names. </p>
<p>Magnus ate with Luna-patience, experiencing each bite as eternal present. Sarah ate Earth-style, already thinking ahead to the next course, mentally calculating bedtime and tomorrow's school run and the project deadline on Monday. Between them, Luna constructed elaborate architectures from her breadsticks, building structures that seemed to exist in more than three dimensions.</p>
<p>Luna ordered "the red circle food" and got pasta somehow. The waiter, bless him, had learned to translate her spatial descriptions into menu items.</p>
<p>"A toast," Sarah raised her glass. "To ten years."</p>
<p>"To now," Magnus countered.</p>
<p>"To between," Luna added, raising her water.</p>
<p>They clinked glasses across consciousness gaps. The wine was perfect. The food was perfect. The translation was broken. The love persisted.</p>
<p>Walking home, Luna between them, Sarah asked: "Do you think we'll make it to twenty?"</p>
<p>"We're already there," Magnus said. "Were there. Will be—"</p>
<p>"I mean really. Actually. Will we still be married in ten more years?"</p>
<p>He stopped. Luna stopped. Sarah took three more Earth-steps before realizing, turning back.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said. Luna-honest. "I can't see Earth-future. Can only see now, which contains all times. In now, we are married. In now, we love. In now, we fail to understand and succeed at continuing. Is that enough?"</p>
<p>"It has to be," Sarah said.</p>
<p>"No," Luna corrected. "It chooses to be."</p>
<p>They walked home through Amsterdam streets. Earth-time 9:47 PM. Luna-time eternal. Luna-time impossible to say.</p>
<p>In bed, after their daughter was asleep, they made love in the language they'd developed. Touch where words failed. Breath where meaning broke. The frequency of skin on skin, consciousness on consciousness, trying to bridge unbridgeable gaps.</p>
<p>Sarah traced the scars on Magnus's shoulder from the construction accident in year six—when his Luna-patience had met Earth-urgent machinery. He'd perceived the falling beam as arriving, not arrived, and moved a second too late by Earth standards. She'd aged a year in the hospital waiting room while he experienced his recovery as a single, continuous moment of healing.</p>
<p>"Happy anniversary," Sarah whispered after.</p>
<p>"Happy now," Magnus replied.</p>
<p>She didn't correct him. He didn't elaborate. They held each other across the beautiful failure of translation, the impossible success of love despite incomprehension.</p>
<p>Through the wall, they could hear Luna singing in her sleep—wordless melodies that seemed to harmonize with themselves, past and future versions creating impossible chords. Their daughter, the bridge neither of them could fully cross but both could meet upon.</p>
<p>Ten years of marriage. 73.2% understanding. 100% commitment to the space between.</p>
<p>The numbers didn't add up.</p>
<p>They never had.</p>
<p>That was the point.</p>
<p>Outside, Amsterdam continued its Earth-rhythm. Inside, their family existed in its own temporal bubble—three consciousnesses orbiting each other, held together not by understanding but by the gravity of choosing to stay. Tomorrow would bring new translation failures, new miscommunications, new moments of Luna explaining what neither parent could see.</p>
<p>But tonight, in the space between Earth-time and Luna-time, in the frequency their daughter called home, they were exactly where they needed to be. Were. Are. Will be.</p>
<p>All tenses at once, inadequately translated, perfectly loved.</p>
