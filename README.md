## About the Project

This is an open-source literary project that explores themes of:
- Communication breakdown despite good intentions
- Love persisting when understanding fails  
- The beauty in inevitable separation
- Human connection across incomprehensible difference

## Book 1: The Beautiful Failure

The first book follows three families across Earth, Mars, and Luna between 2095-2125. Through 12 interconnected stories, we witness humanity's consciousness beginning to diverge based on the gravity of their worldsnot through conflict or technology gone wrong, but through the simple fact of living under different stars.
