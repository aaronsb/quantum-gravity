# The Last Clear Conversation

Sarah and Erik sat in their Amsterdam apartment, Earth-time 9 PM, Luna-time irrelevant because he'd been back for three months. The wedding was in two days. Everything was ready except them.

"We need to talk," Sarah said. Earth-words, Earth-quick, Earth-urgent.

Erik looked up from the book he'd been reading—or not reading, just holding. Since his return, he did that. Held objects like they were thoughts. Stood at windows like they were philosophy.

"Yes," he said. Simple agreement, but weighted with Luna patience.

She'd practiced this conversation. Planned it. But looking at him—her Erik, not-quite-her-Erik—the words scattered.

"You're different." Starting was starting. "Not bad different. Just... different."

"I am." No defense, no explanation. Luna had taught him to acknowledge without justifying.

"When you look at me, what do you see?"

He set the book down with the kind of care that made her chest tight. Everything he did now had that quality—deliberate, complete, honoring the action itself rather than rushing to the next.

"I see you," he said. "Sarah-now. Sarah-then. Sarah-tomorrow. All at once, which makes you..." He paused, searching. "Prismatic. You refract through time."

"That's not how people work."

"It's how Luna-people work." He leaned back. The chair held him differently than it held her—she perched, ready to spring. He settled, ready to stay. "On Earth, you see people in slices. This moment's Sarah. Next moment's Sarah. Sequential."

"And on Luna?"

"On Luna, we see duration. The whole person across their timeline. It's why..." Another pause. She'd learned to wait through them, though her fingers still tapped Earth-rhythms on her knee. "It's why rushing makes no sense. You're already there. Were there. Will be there."

Sarah stood, needing to move. Earth bodies in motion, staying in motion. "But I'm not there. I'm here. Now. Getting married in two days to someone who sees me as some kind of... time-smear."

"Not smear." He remained still, watching her pace. "Symphony. All your notes playing at once."

"That must be deafening."

"It's beautiful." He said it simply, factually. Luna had burned the poetry out of his words, or maybe burned poetry into them so deeply it became invisible. "But yes. Sometimes deafening."

She stopped at the window. Amsterdam spread below, canals like circuits, lights like urgent data. "The counselor says we're incompatible. Consciousness-divergent."

"We are."

"She recommended postponing. Or canceling. Or..." Sarah's voice cracked. "Or you going back. Permanently. Before we get more invested."

"More invested." He turned the phrase over like the book he'd been holding. "Earth concept. As if love is currency."

"Don't do that." She spun to face him. "Don't make me feel shallow for thinking in Earth terms. They're the only terms I have."

"I know." He stood then, moved toward her with that new gravity. Not slow—patient. Every step deliberate. "I'm not criticizing. I'm translating. Badly."

"The AI translates at 73.2%."

"The AI translates words." He stopped just out of reach. Close enough to touch, far enough to honor the distance between their ways of being. "We need to translate silence."

"I don't speak silence."

"You do. Just not Luna silence." He gestured at the space between them. "This gap. On Earth it means problem. On Luna it means possibility."

"For what?"

"For choosing." His eyes held that depth she couldn't read anymore. Patient eyes. Stone eyes. Loving eyes that loved at a frequency she couldn't match. "Do we marry knowing we'll always mistranslate? Do we love across the gap? Or do we love the gap itself?"

"I don't know what that means."

"Neither do I. In Earth words." He smiled then, and for a moment he was just Erik. Her Erik. The one who'd spilled coffee in Singapore and apologized in three languages. "But I know it in Luna words. And you know it in Earth words. Maybe that's enough."

"Is it?" She was crying now. Earth tears, quick and hot. "Is knowing in different languages enough for a marriage?"

He reached out. She took his hand. The touch was the same—warm, familiar, his. But the holding was different. He held her hand like it was a complete thought. She held his like it was a question.

"I don't know," he said. "But I want to find out. At Luna speed. At Earth speed. At whatever speed we create together."

They stood there, holding hands across consciousness gaps. Outside, Amsterdam hummed with Earth urgency. Inside, their apartment held Luna patience. Between them, something new—not Earth, not Luna, but the liminal space where love insisted on existing despite impossible translation.

"If we do this," Sarah said, "if we get married anyway. What happens when we can't understand each other at all?"

"Then we love without understanding." He squeezed her hand. Earth-pressure, Luna-duration. "Like humans always have. Just more honestly."

She laughed—wet, broken, real. "That's either the most romantic or most terrifying thing you've ever said."

"Both," he agreed. "Earth teaches or. Luna teaches and."

"And you?" She stepped closer, into the gap. "What do you teach?"

"Nothing. I'm just trying to learn you. In all your tenses. At all your speeds." He pulled her close. She let him. "It will take forever. Luna forever, which is different from Earth forever. But still. Forever."

They held each other in their Amsterdam apartment. Earth-time 10:17 PM. Luna-time always. The last clear conversation they'd have, where words meant mostly what they seemed to mean. 

In two days, they'd marry. In five years, they'd barely speak the same language. In ten years, they'd find ways to love through silence.

But tonight, in the space between Earth-urgent and Luna-patient, they stood together. Understanding just enough. Loving across the gap.

It would have to be enough.

It would be everything.
