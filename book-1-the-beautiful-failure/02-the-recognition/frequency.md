# Frequency

Dev Patel called his sister on a Thursday. Two years since the dinner where he'd stopped making sense.

"Priya?" His face resolved on her laptop screen. Mars-lag made his smile arrive late.

"Dev!" She minimized her lab report. "Holy shit, you actually called."

"I've been..." He paused. That pause she remembered. But longer now, like it had grown rooms. "Thinking about waves."

"Waves?" Priya tucked her feet under her in the desk chair. "Like ocean waves?"

"Like us waves. You and me waves." His eyes tracked something off-screen. Mars dust storm, maybe. Or nothing at all. "We vibrate at different frequencies now."

"That's—" She stopped herself from saying 'ridiculous.' Two years of failed conversations had taught her that Earth-words could wound across space. "Tell me about it."

Dev leaned back. The Mars habitat behind him looked aggressively normal—bed, desk, photos on the wall. But the shadows fell wrong. Gravity painted everything with a different brush.

"Do you remember," he said, "when we were kids? That game?"

"Which game?"

"Where we'd sit back to back. Try to breathe at the same time."

"God, yes." Priya laughed. "You always said you could feel my thoughts through my spine."

"I could." No laugh. Statement of fact, Mars-certain. "Can't anymore."

She shifted in her chair. "We're not sitting back to back, Dev. You're literally on another planet."

"No." He shook his head slowly. "Even if you were here. Or I was there. The frequency is wrong now."

"What frequency?"

He held up his hand. She watched it move—too slow, too careful. Like someone underwater. Or someone who'd forgotten what air meant.

"Watch," he said.

He started tapping. Index finger against thumb. A rhythm. 

Tap. Tap. Tap.

"Now you," he said.

She felt ridiculous but copied him. Tap. Tap. Tap.

"Faster," he said.

She sped up. Her Earth-fingers moving at Earth-speed. Quick, efficient, already thinking ahead.

"I can't slow down enough," he said. "You can't speed up enough. We're out of sync."

"It's just lag—"

"It's not lag." He was still tapping, still trying to match her rhythm across impossible distance. "It's frequency. Earth consciousness vibrates at..." He stopped. Looked frustrated. "There's no word. You feel time like—like popcorn. Lots of little explosions."

"And Mars?"

"Mars feels time like sedimentation. Layer after layer. Building." His hand stilled. "I can't think fast enough to be your brother anymore."

"That's—you're scaring me, Dev."

"I know." His eyes finally met hers through the screen. "I scare me too. But not the same scare. Your scared is spike-sharp. Mine is...erosion-scared. Slow scared. Patient scared."

Priya's throat felt tight. "Are you okay? Do you need—what do you need?"

The pause stretched. In it, she heard twenty-two years of shared jokes, shared dreams, shared DNA expressing itself in divergent gravities.

"I need you to know," Dev finally said, "that I love you at my frequency. Even though it doesn't sync with yours anymore. Love you like sediment loves stone. Slow and permanent and—"

"Stop." Priya's Earth-voice cracked. "Just stop. Talk normal. Be normal. Be my brother."

"I am your brother." The certainty in his voice made it worse. "Just not at your speed. Not at your rhythm. I'm your brother the way Mars has water. Had water. Will have water. All tenses at once because time is—"

She slammed the laptop shut.

Sat in her dorm room shaking. Earth-shaking. Quick violent trembles that wanted immediate comfort, instant resolution.

Her phone buzzed. Message from Dev. She almost didn't open it.

*I'm sorry. That's an Earth word but I mean it at Mars depth. I wanted to feel our old frequency one more time. Instead I proved it's gone. Love you, Pri. Love you at the speed of stone.*

She typed back: *Love you too.*

Deleted it.

Typed: *I don't understand what's happening to you.*

Deleted it.

Typed: *Come home.*

Stared at those two words until they blurred. Come home. As if home was a place. As if Dev could fit back into Earth-shaped life. As if frequency was something you could choose instead of something that chose you.

She sent: *I'll try to slow down.*

His response took forty minutes. Or maybe he just thought that long.

*I'll try to speed up.*

They both knew they were lying. But it was a lie at both frequencies—Earth-quick deception and Mars-slow fiction. Maybe that counted as harmony. Maybe that was all they had left.

Priya opened her laptop. Went back to her lab report on molecular vibrations. Everything in the universe hummed at its own frequency. She'd known that.

She just hadn't known it applied to brothers.
