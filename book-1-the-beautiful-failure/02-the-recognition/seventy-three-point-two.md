# 73.2%

Sarah Okafor-Jensen stared at the number on her screen. It hadn't changed in six months.

"Translation accuracy: 73.2%"

Every conversation with Erik. Every message. Every "I love you" filtered through an algorithm that had stopped trying to be perfect.

She scrolled through their chat history, watching the percentage drift:

January 2118: 94.7%
March 2118: 89.3%
July 2118: 81.6%
October 2118: 76.9%
February 2119: 73.2%
March 2119: 73.2%
April 2119: 73.2%

And there it stuck. Like a boat run aground on an invisible reef.

"TransLingua customer service, this is Raj. How can I help you today?"

"My translation accuracy is stuck." Sarah paced her apartment, Earth-quick steps eating distance. "It's been 73.2% for six months. Between Earth and Luna. That can't be right."

"Let me check your account." Keyboard clicks. "I see you have our Premium Cross-Gravity package. Running diagnostics now."

Sarah waited. Through her window, Luna hung in the afternoon sky. Erik was up there, probably having lunch. Or what he called lunch—that meal that happened in the eternal present tense of Luna consciousness.

"Ma'am? The system is functioning normally."

"It's stuck at 73.2%."

"Yes, ma'am. That's... that's the maximum accuracy between Earth and Luna consciousnesses."

"What?"

"I have a note here from our engineering team." Raj cleared his throat. "Quote: 'Translation accuracy plateaus when conceptual frameworks diverge beyond algorithmic bridging. 73.2% represents successful word translation with 26.8% meaning loss due to incompatible consciousness structures.' End quote."

"That's—that's ridiculous. You're telling me your premium service just gives up?"

"It doesn't give up, ma'am. It reaches the limits of translation. Like... imagine translating color for someone who sees different wavelengths. You can say 'red,' but if their red isn't your red..."

Sarah hung up.

Sat on her couch.

Opened Erik's last message:

*The wedding approaches with the patience of stone. I am becoming ready in ways that Earth-time doesn't measure. Your love arrives here like light from a star—traveled far, still warm, but from a you who already moved on. I love all the yous: the one who sent the message, the one who exists now, the one you'll be when this reaches you. Time is a gift here. Not a river. Does this translate?*

The AI had marked half the words with uncertainty-blue. 73.2% accurate. Which meant 26.8% lost. 

Which parts? Which words carried meaning and which carried silence?

She typed back: *I don't understand how time can be a gift. Time is what we're running out of.*

Send.

Three minutes later, her response arrived on Luna. Three minutes after that, Erik would read it. In those six minutes, she made coffee, answered two work emails, worried about the caterer, wondered if her dress would fit, checked the weather for June.

Erik would read it in the continuous now of Luna. No before-message, no after-message. Just message, existing in the eternal moment of receipt.

Her phone buzzed. Not Erik—her maid of honor, asking about rehearsal dinner details. Then her mom, forwarding wedding registry suggestions. Then work, always work, urgent-urgent-urgent.

Erik's reply came an hour later: *Running out of implies time is a resource. Here, time is architecture. We don't spend it. We inhabit it. The wedding isn't approaching—we are building toward each other across patient space. Does this translate?*

73.2%

Sarah called him. Video this time. Need to see his face, even delayed.

He answered on the fourth ring. Luna-slow, but he was smiling.

"Hello, love." His words arrived 2.6 seconds late.

"Erik, I'm scared." The words tumbled out Earth-fast. "The translator says we're stuck at 73.2%. That's barely passing. That's a C+. How can we get married with a C+ understanding of each other?"

He listened. Processed. The delay made her keep talking.

"Maybe we should postpone. Maybe I should come there for longer. Maybe you should—"

"Sarah." Just her name, but it carried Luna-weight. Stopped her spiral. "Do you love me?"

"Of course!"

"That translated. 100%. Love translates. The rest—time and presence and the color of silence—those are just vocabulary. But love translates."

"Does it? Or does the AI just tell us it does? What if your love and my love are as different as your time and my time?"

The longest pause yet. On Earth, it would mean hesitation. On Luna, it meant consideration.

"Then we love across the difference," he finally said. "With 73.2% understanding and 100% commitment. The gap... the gap is where grace lives."

After the call, Sarah sat with the number. 73.2%. Not falling anymore, but not rising either. The limit of translation between worlds.

She pulled up their first messages, from when Erik was still on Earth. 100% accuracy. Perfect understanding. And yet... had they understood each other better then? Or just assumed they did?

Her phone showed seventeen new messages. Earth spinning fast, demanding attention, eating time.

She turned it off.

Sat in silence.

Tried to feel time as architecture instead of river.

Failed.

But in the failing, she found something. A shape. A space. A place where 73.2% might be enough, if she could learn to love across the gap.

The wedding was in three months.

Or, as Erik would say, the wedding is. Was. Will be.

All tenses at once, 73.2% translated.
