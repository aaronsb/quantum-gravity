# The Untranslatable Word

The poetry reading was held at New Shanghai University, Earth campus. Dr. Yuki Tanaka from Mars was the featured speaker, presenting her collection "Red Silence." The auditorium was full—students, faculty, and the genuinely curious drawn by rumors of Martian verse that broke translation software.

Mei Chen sat in the third row, her mother Liu beside her. Now sixteen, Mei moved with Mars rhythms that three years of Earth doctors couldn't cure. She'd wanted to come. Needed to come. Liu had agreed, hoping exposure to Mars art might help her understand her daughter's growing silence.

"Welcome," Dr. Tanaka said. She stood at the podium with stillness that made the air around her seem busy. "I will read in English, Mandarin, and..." A pause that wasn't hesitation. "Mars."

Someone laughed nervously. Mars wasn't a language. Mars was a place.

Dr. Tanaka opened her book. The pages were mostly white space.

"First poem," she said. "Title translates as 'Morning.' But that's wrong. Morning is Earth concept. Mars has—" She stopped. Looked at the audience with eyes that had seen different sunrises. "I'll just read."

She began in English:

"The absence wakes before the presence,
Shadow withdraws revealing stone—"

Then Mandarin, the same words but different weight. Then she opened her mouth and made a sound that wasn't quite speech. A soft exhalation that became a whisper that became silence that somehow continued.

In the third row, Mei leaned forward.

"What was that?" someone called out.

"The word," Dr. Tanaka said, "for the space between night and not-night. Where darkness doesn't become light but admits it was never complete dark. English has no—Mandarin has no—Earth has no equivalent."

She read another poem. This time when the untranslatable word came, she held her hand up, palm out, fingers spread. The gesture meant something Mei almost understood.

Liu watched her daughter's face transform. Recognition without comprehension. Like seeing a childhood photo of someone you'd never met but knowing it was family.

"The translator says 'sorrow,'" Dr. Tanaka continued. "But it's not sorrow. It's—" She made another sound. Hollow but not empty. An absence with architecture. "It's the shape left when water forgets how to be water. The memory of fullness in a dry riverbed. Earth sadness moves. This doesn't move. This acknowledges."

A student raised her hand. "Can you teach us? The words?"

"No." Simple as gravity. "Your throat is wrong. Your silence is wrong. You breathe Earth air with Earth lungs thinking Earth thoughts. The words are possible only when absence has weight. When silence has color. When—"

"When you're broken," someone muttered.

Dr. Tanaka turned toward the voice. Her movement had strange physics—too slow, too complete.

"Not broken," she said. "Attuned to different music. Earth consciousness is symphony—many instruments, much noise, beautiful chaos. Mars consciousness is...one string vibrating in vast space. Both music. Different music."

She read more poems. Each one had gaps where Earth-words failed. The audience grew restless, frustrated. They'd come for poetry and found philosophy. Found incomprehension.

But Mei understood. Not the words—the words were impossible. But the space around them. The pause that meant more than speech. The gesture that carried what voice couldn't.

During the Q&A, Liu raised her hand. "My daughter was born on Mars. Came to Earth young. She seems—between. Can you help her?"

Dr. Tanaka looked at Mei. Really looked. The kind of seeing that took time.

"What's your name?"

"Mei."

"Mei." She said it differently. Not mispronunciation—a different relationship to the sound. "Do you dream in red?"

Mei nodded.

"Do you wake in the space between sleep and not-sleep?"

Another nod.

"Then you know—" Dr. Tanaka made the first sound again. The word that wasn't word. The meaning that Earth couldn't hold.

And Mei did know. Knew it like bone-deep memory. Like the taste of water that wasn't there. Like home that existed in the space between homes.

"Yes," Mei whispered.

The auditorium was quiet. Liu reached for her daughter's hand. Mei took it, but her grip felt different. Loving but distant. Present but elsewhere.

After the reading, in the lobby, Dr. Tanaka approached them.

"Your daughter," she said to Liu, "is lucky."

"Lucky?" Liu's voice cracked. "She barely speaks. She draws absences. Her teachers think—"

"She's bilingual," Dr. Tanaka interrupted. "Conscious in two frequencies. It's hard now. Will get harder. But someday, when Earth needs to speak to Mars, truly speak, not just exchange words—she'll be the bridge."

She handed Mei a slim book. Handwritten. More white space than text.

"Practice," she said. "The words you can't say. Draw them. Dance them. Dream them. They're yours too."

Mei clutched the book. Inside, she knew, were the shapes of thoughts she'd never been able to explain. The pause that meant everything. The silence that sang.

"Thank you," she said in English. Then made a gesture—hand to chest, fingers spreading outward. 

Dr. Tanaka smiled and returned it.

Liu didn't understand the exchange. But she recognized goodbye in any language. Even languages that weren't.
