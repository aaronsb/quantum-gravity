## Sample Opening Lines
"On her sixteenth birthday, Maya felt Mars pulling at her thoughts like a tide she couldn't swim against."

"The test was simple: Which silence felt like home?"

"Jordan had forty-eight hours left to be everyone's child. After that, gravity would claim them."

## Remember
The choice isn't between good and bad options—it's between different ways of being human. The horror is that choosing yourself means losing others. The beauty is that you still choose.
