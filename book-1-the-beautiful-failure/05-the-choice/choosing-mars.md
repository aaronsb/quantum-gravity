# Choosing Mars

Priya Patel stood in the medical center's white room, looking at three pills in her palm. Red for Mars. Gray for Luna. Blue for Earth.

"It's not a pill," Dr. Morrison explained again. "It's a neural stabilizer. Helps your consciousness settle into its natural resonance without interference from—"

"I know what it is." Priya closed her fist around the choices. "I've done the research."

She had. Six months of research since her twentieth birthday. The age when consciousness became fixed, when the choice became permanent. When you stopped being everyone's child and became one world's adult.

"Your parents?"

"Dad wants Earth. Mom wants 'whatever makes me happy.'" Priya laughed, short and sharp. "Dev chose Mars five years ago. They want one kid they can understand."

"And you? What do you want?"

That was the question. What she wanted changed with her location—Earth-quick desires when she was home, Mars-slow certainties when she visited Dev, Luna-patient perspective when she'd gone to see...

No. Don't think about Erik yet.

"I dream in red," she said. "Have since I was fifteen. But when I'm awake, I think in Earth patterns. Except when I'm composing—then I think in circles. Luna circles."

Dr. Morrison nodded. She'd heard variations of this before. The between-generation, caught in gravitational tides. "You compose?"

"Music. Or what I call music. Earth audiences hear chaos. Mars audiences hear too much presence. Luna..." She paused. "Luna understands, but says I'm rushing."

"Show me."

Priya pulled out her phone, played her latest composition. Notes that seemed to argue with themselves, rhythms that started Earth-fast then stretched into Mars-silence then circled back like Luna-time. It was beautiful. It was terrible. It was hers.

"I see," Dr. Morrison said when it ended. "You're already between. The stabilizer will just—"

"Force me to choose a side." Priya opened her hand again. Three pills. Three futures. Three ways of never quite being herself. "What happens if I don't?"

"Without stabilization?" The doctor's face went clinical. "Cognitive dissonance. Headaches, certainly. Difficulty maintaining relationships. You'll never fully settle into any consciousness pattern. Never fully belong anywhere."

"But I'll be all of them?"

"No. You'll be none of them. Between-consciousness isn't a stable state. It's a constant translation error."

Priya thought of Dev, how his messages now came wrapped in silence she couldn't parse. Thought of her Earth friends, how their urgency exhausted her. Thought of Erik—

Yes. Think of Erik now.

She'd met him at Mei Chen's exhibition. He was visiting from Luna, studying Earth art to understand his wife better. They'd talked for hours about the space between meanings, about music that lived in gaps, about consciousness as composition rather than choice.

He was forty-three. She was nineteen. On Earth, scandal. On Luna, a conversation between equals. On Mars, irrelevant—age was just accumulated absence.

They hadn't touched. Hadn't even exchanged contacts. But she'd felt something shift, like tectonic plates of consciousness grinding past each other. A frequency between frequencies.

"I need time," Priya said.

"You have one week. After that, the window closes. Your brain solidifies its patterns." Dr. Morrison stood. "Choose wisely. You're choosing who you'll be for the next hundred years."

Priya left with the pills in her pocket. Three futures rattling against each other.

She called Dev. Twenty-minute delay each way, but she needed her brother's voice.

"I don't know how to choose," she said to the void.

His answer came while she made lunch: "You already have chosen. You're just afraid to know it."

She messaged her Earth friends. Their responses came instantly: "Choose Earth!" "Don't leave us!" "Mars is so weird now!" The urgency made her tired.

She sat at her keyboard, trying to compose. But the music kept fracturing. Earth harmonies crashing into Mars spaces, Luna circles tangling the rhythm. Between-music. Translation-error music. Hers.

On the sixth day, she walked to the spaceport. Not to leave—just to watch. Earth shuttles launching quick and bright. Mars vessels moving with geological patience. Luna ships following perfect arcs.

"You're Priya Patel."

She turned. Erik stood there, waiting for a Luna flight. His wife was with him—Sarah, Earth-quick, Earth-beautiful, holding his hand across consciousness gaps.

"I remember your music," he said. "From the gallery."

Sarah looked between them, Earth-instincts reading undercurrents. But she smiled. "You're the composer? Erik played me your piece. It's..."

"Untranslatable," Priya finished.

"Yes." Sarah's smile went sad. "Like everything important."

They talked while waiting for their flight. About music, about choice, about the space between worlds. Sarah's hand never left Erik's, but her eyes held understanding. She knew about loving across gaps. About choosing the space between.

"What will you choose?" Erik asked as their flight was called.

Priya pulled out the three pills. Looked at them. At Erik and Sarah—Earth and Luna, loving through mistranslation. At the ships launching toward different gravities.

"I don't know," she said.

But that was a lie.

She knew.

Had known since she'd started composing music that no single world could hold. Since she'd felt comfortable nowhere and everywhere. Since she'd realized her frequency wasn't Mars or Earth or Luna but the interference pattern between them.

After they left, Priya sat in the spaceport café. Took out the pills. Red. Gray. Blue.

Swallowed all three at once.

The medical center would call it an error. A dangerous mistake. Mixing stabilizers, creating chaos instead of clarity.

But as the chemicals hit her bloodstream, Priya felt her consciousness not fragment but crystallize. Into something new. Something between. Something that would spend the next hundred years translating between worlds, never belonging, always bridging.

She opened her phone. Started composing.

The music that came was impossible. Earth urgency threading through Mars absence. Luna circles that never quite closed. It hurt to create. Hurt to hear. Hurt to be.

But it was hers.

She was twenty years old, and she'd chosen not to choose. Chosen to be the space between. The translation error. The frequency that belonged nowhere.

The beautiful failure.

Dev would understand, in his Mars way. Her parents would worry, in their Earth way. Erik might hear it someday and recognize a fellow refugee from single consciousness.

But really, she'd chosen for the music. For the compositions that needed all three gravities to exist. For the art that lived in gaps.

The headaches started an hour later.

They would never stop.

She would never care.
