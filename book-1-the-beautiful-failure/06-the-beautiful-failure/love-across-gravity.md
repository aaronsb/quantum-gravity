# Love Across Gravity

Sarah and Erik's tenth anniversary arrived like everything in their marriage—at different speeds for each of them.

She woke Earth-quick, already thinking of the restaurant reservation, the gift hidden in her closet, the babysitter for Luna who'd need specific instructions about their daughter's peculiar patience. Anniversary meant event. Meant marking time. Meant celebration of duration.

Erik woke as he always did—fully present, as if sleep was just another room in the house of consciousness. For him, their anniversary wasn't arriving. It simply was. Had been. Would be.

"Happy anniversary," Sarah said, kissing him Earth-quick.

He caught her face between his hands, held her with Luna-patience until the kiss became something else. Not Earth-urgent or Luna-eternal but the frequency they'd found between them. The compromise of touch when words had failed.

"Anniversary," he repeated. The word meant something different in his mouth. Not milestone but moment. Not achievement but existence.

Their daughter Luna appeared in the doorway. Seven years old, born between worlds, speaking neither Earth nor Luna but something new. She watched them with eyes that tracked time differently than either parent.

"Today is the day," she said. Not question, not statement. Something between.

"Yes, baby," Sarah said. "Mama and Papa's special day."

"All days are special." Luna moved into the room with inherited patience. "But this one has a name."

Erik lifted her, settled her between them. Their trilingual family—Earth, Luna, and whatever Luna was becoming. The translators had given up on their household years ago. Too many frequencies intersecting.

"Tell us a story," Luna requested. Their morning ritual.

Sarah began Earth-style: "Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved a boy across impossible distance—"

"No time," Luna corrected gently. "Stories don't have time."

Erik continued Luna-style: "There is a girl who loves a boy. Was. Will be. The distance between them is always the same, always different."

"No distance," Luna said. "Love doesn't have distance."

They looked at their daughter. Seven years old and already untranslatable. Her consciousness wasn't Earth or Luna or even between. It was beyond. Past the edges of what they'd thought possible.

"Then you tell it," Sarah said.

Luna settled back, found words in her impossible language: "Love is. People are. Between is. The end."

Four sentences that held their entire marriage. Sarah laughed—Earth-bright. Erik smiled—Luna-deep. Luna hummed—something neither parent could name.

Later, at breakfast, the translation failures multiplied:

"Pass the—" Sarah gestured at the jam.

"The red patience," Erik said, handing it over.

"Strawberries aren't patient," Luna observed.

"Earth strawberries aren't," Erik agreed. "But the concept of preserved sweetness—"

"It's just jam," Sarah said, spreading it Earth-quick on toast.

"Nothing is just," Luna said.

By noon, Sarah felt the familiar anniversary tension. Ten years of trying to celebrate across consciousness gaps. Ten years of presents that didn't translate, dinners where they sat at the same table in different timestreams, toasts that meant celebration to her and presence to him.

"I have a gift," she told Erik while Luna napped.

"Yes," he said. Not agreement—acknowledgment. He experienced her having a gift as a continuous state, not a revelation.

She gave him the watch. Expensive. Engraved. A Earth-symbol of time marked and measured.

He held it like he held everything—completely. Then set it aside and pulled her close.

"I have a gift too," he said.

She waited. He was still. The moment stretched, Luna-long.

"This," he finally said.

"This what?"

"This. Now. Us. The gift is the anniversary itself." He touched her face. "Ten years Earth-time. Eternity Luna-time. Both. Neither. The space between where we live."

"That's not a gift. That's just... life."

"Yes."

She wanted to be frustrated. Wanted to demand something concrete, Earth-real. But looking at him—at them—at their impossible marriage that worked despite not working...

"I don't understand you," she said.

"I don't understand you," he agreed.

"But I love you."

"But I love you."

Luna wandered in, trailing her afternoon nap like a blanket. "Are you fighting?"

"No, baby."

"Yes," Erik said simultaneously.

Luna nodded. "Fighting-loving. Like when I speak and you don't hear but you listen anyway."

Out of the mouths of between-world babes.

That evening, they went to dinner. The restaurant was Earth-fancy, courses timed and presented with urgency. Erik ate with Luna-patience, experiencing each bite as eternal present. Sarah ate Earth-style, already thinking ahead to the next course.

Luna ordered "the red circle food" and got pasta somehow.

"A toast," Sarah raised her glass. "To ten years."

"To now," Erik countered.

"To between," Luna added, raising her water.

They clinked glasses across consciousness gaps. The wine was perfect. The food was perfect. The translation was broken. The love persisted.

Walking home, Luna between them, Sarah asked: "Do you think we'll make it to twenty?"

"We're already there," Erik said. "Were there. Will be—"

"I mean really. Actually. Will we still be married in ten more years?"

He stopped. Luna stopped. Sarah took three more Earth-steps before realizing, turning back.

"I don't know," he said. Luna-honest. "I can't see Earth-future. Can only see now, which contains all times. In now, we are married. In now, we love. In now, we fail to understand and succeed at continuing. Is that enough?"

"It has to be," Sarah said.

"No," Luna corrected. "It chooses to be."

They walked home through Amsterdam streets. Earth-time 9:47 PM. Luna-time eternal. Luna-time impossible to say.

In bed, after their daughter was asleep, they made love in the language they'd developed. Touch where words failed. Breath where meaning broke. The frequency of skin on skin, consciousness on consciousness, trying to bridge unbridgeable gaps.

"Happy anniversary," Sarah whispered after.

"Happy now," Erik replied.

She didn't correct him. He didn't elaborate. They held each other across the beautiful failure of translation, the impossible success of love despite incomprehension.

Ten years of marriage. 73.2% understanding. 100% commitment to the space between.

The numbers didn't add up.

They never had.

That was the point.
