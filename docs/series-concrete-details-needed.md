# Concrete Details Needed for Series

## Overview
The series has strong philosophical framework and continuity. To make it truly compelling, we need specific sensory details, memorable character moments, and lived experiences that readers can feel.

## Sensory Details by World

### Earth
- **Food**: How spices hit differently - too intense, chaotic flavoring
- **Sound**: Overlapping conversations, no one waits for silence
- **Movement**: Quick gestures, constant fidgeting, can't be still
- **Spaces**: Cluttered, organic, never quite organized
- **Specific**: Coffee tastes "aggressive" to other worlds

### Mars  
- **Food**: Subtle flavors others miss, beauty in what's not there
- **Sound**: Long silences that speak volumes, incomplete sentences
- **Movement**: Economical, nothing wasted, pauses between actions
- **Spaces**: Negative space as art, emptiness as fullness
- **Specific**: Tea ceremonies that take hours, mostly silence

### Luna
- **Food**: Meals that take days, flavors unfolding slowly
- **Sound**: Music with 20-minute notes, conversations across years
- **Movement**: Glacial but purposeful, no hurry ever
- **Spaces**: Built for centuries, patience made physical
- **Specific**: Their "quick" meetings last 8 hours minimum

### Proxima
- **Food**: Love it or hate it, no "pretty good"
- **Sound**: Statements not questions, no maybes in speech
- **Movement**: Decisive, no hesitation, commit fully
- **Spaces**: Clear functions, no multipurpose anything
- **Specific**: Art is either masterpiece or garbage, no middle

### Belt
- **Food**: Consumed quickly, no lingering meals
- **Sound**: Everything temporary, no permanent recordings
- **Movement**: Always ready to move, nothing anchored
- **Spaces**: Modular, changeable, nothing fixed
- **Specific**: They don't have photo albums - only present matters

## Character-Defining Moments Needed

### Mei Chen
- First sculpture: empty frame that makes her cry
- Argument with parents about "seeing nothing"  
- The moment she realizes she's Mars-consciousness
- Her famous piece: shadows where light should be

### Luna (the recorder)
- Physical sensation when consciousness types clash
- Trying to explain the headaches to parents
- The day she starts recording everything
- Last recording before death: "The patterns are beautiful"

### Sarah & Magnus
- Their first date: comedy of time misunderstandings
- The fight about "rushing" vs "patience"
- Last successful translation between them
- Final meeting: love visible but words fail

### Dev & Priya Patel
- Childhood game they can't play anymore
- The dinner where they realize they've diverged  
- Choosing different worlds at age 16
- Their kids meeting and feeling nothing

## Daily Life Specifics (Individual Variations)

### Morning Routines - Examples Not Rules
- Earth engineer Jin: Methodical breakfast, hates chaos
- Earth artist Rosa: Three projects while eating
- Mars teen Alara: Quick breakfast, annoys parents
- Mars elder: Hour-long tea meditation
- Luna newcomer: Still rushing, locals amused
- Luna native: Some take hours, some don't
- Proxima morning varies: Eat/not-eat is personal
- Belt: Some create elaborate rituals in motion

### Work Culture - Spectrums Not Monoliths  
- Earth has focus addicts and chaos surfers
- Mars deep workers AND quick responders exist
- Luna has impatient youth, patient only relative
- Proxima: Binary choice but which binary varies
- Belt: Some maintain 40-year "temporary" jobs

### Social Gatherings - All Types Everywhere
- Quiet Earth introverts hosting silent dinners
- Mars party-lovers who fill absence with joy
- Luna speed-dating (only 3 hours!)
- Proxima casual connections (committed to casualness)
- Belt forming lasting bonds despite ideology

### The Key: Tendencies Not Destinies
- Gravity influences but doesn't determine
- Personal variation within statistical patterns
- Resistance and embrace both happen
- Hybrids complicate every category
- Change happens at different rates

## Memorable Dialogue Examples

### Translation Failures
Earth: "I love you, maybe we couldâ€”"
Proxima: "Love yes or love no. Maybe is lie."

Mars: "The emptiness between us is..."
Earth: "There's nothing between us!"
Mars: "Exactly. Beautiful."

Luna: "When we met yesterday..."
Earth: "That was three months ago!"
Luna: "Yes, yesterday."

### Humor Moments
- Earth person on Luna: "When does the meeting start?" "It started." "When?" "Always."
- Mars person on Earth: "This pizza has too much presence."
- Proxima trying Earth dating: "Commit now or leave." (First date)
- Belt visiting Luna: "Your temporary house is made of stone?"

Through specific, sensory, human details, the philosophical becomes personal.
