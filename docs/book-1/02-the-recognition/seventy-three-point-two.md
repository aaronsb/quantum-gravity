# 73.2%

Sarah Okafor-Jensen had once believed in perfect understanding. Back when she and Magnus would spend entire weekends in their Amsterdam apartment, talking through the night about terraforming Mars and the ethics of consciousness modification. Back when they could finish each other's sentences, before Luna's gravity began its slow work on his neural pathways. She'd been a project manager at Terraform Solutions then, coordinating sustainable habitat designs for the growing off-world colonies. Magnus had been her favorite consultant—the structural engineer who understood that buildings weren't just about surviving in low gravity, but about creating spaces where humans could thrive.

Now she stared at the number on her screen. It hadn't changed in six months.

"Translation accuracy: 73.2%"

Every conversation with Magnus. Every message. Every "I love you" filtered through an algorithm that had stopped trying to be perfect.

Her Amsterdam apartment bore the evidence of two lives trying to merge across 384,400 kilometers. Wedding dress hanging on the bedroom door—a sustainable fabric design from her friend Kaia's studio. Color swatches spread across the dining table: "Lunar Regolith" (too gray), "Earth Sky" (too presumptuous), "Orbital Sunset" (just right, maybe). Vendor contracts stacked by her laptop, each one more urgent than the last. The caterer needed final numbers. The venue wanted to know about gravity accommodations for off-world guests. Her mother kept forwarding articles about "Making Mixed-Gravity Marriages Work."

She scrolled through their chat history, watching the percentage drift:

January 2118: 94.7%
March 2118: 89.3%
July 2118: 81.6%
October 2118: 76.9%
February 2119: 73.2%
March 2119: 73.2%
April 2119: 73.2%

And there it stuck. Like a boat run aground on an invisible reef.

The phone rang four times before connecting. Sarah had already straightened three picture frames and reorganized her project files while waiting—Earth-time making her hands restless, always moving, always doing.

"TransLingua customer service, this is Raj. How can I help you today?"

"My translation accuracy is stuck." Sarah paced her apartment, Earth-quick steps eating distance past the kitchen where she and Magnus used to cook together, around the living room where his engineering awards still hung next to her project management certifications. "It's been 73.2% for six months. Between Earth and Luna. That can't be right."

"Let me check your account." Keyboard clicks. "I see you have our Premium Cross-Gravity package. Running diagnostics now."

Sarah waited. Through her window, Luna hung in the afternoon sky. Magnus was up there, probably having lunch. Or what he called lunch—that meal that happened in the eternal present tense of Luna consciousness.

"Ma'am? The system is functioning normally."

"It's stuck at 73.2%."

"Yes, ma'am. That's... that's the maximum accuracy between Earth and Luna consciousnesses."

"What?"

"I have a note here from our engineering team." Raj cleared his throat. "Quote: 'Translation accuracy plateaus when conceptual frameworks diverge beyond algorithmic bridging. 73.2% represents successful word translation with 26.8% meaning loss due to incompatible consciousness structures.' End quote."

"That's—that's ridiculous. You're telling me your premium service just gives up?"

"It doesn't give up, ma'am. It reaches the limits of translation. Like... imagine translating color for someone who sees different wavelengths. You can say 'red,' but if their red isn't your red..."

Sarah hung up.

The silence in her apartment felt wrong—too empty of Magnus's careful considerations, his way of holding space for thoughts to finish. On Earth, silence meant absence. On Luna, Magnus had tried to explain, silence was presence without urgency. She couldn't grasp it. Her project management brain needed timelines, deliverables, measurable progress. Even now, her fingers itched to update the wedding planning spreadsheet, to check off completed tasks, to feel like something was moving forward.

She sat on their couch—she still thought of it as theirs, though he'd been gone eighteen months. The indent where he used to sit remained, a ghost-weight in the cushions. She opened Magnus's last message:

*The wedding approaches with the patience of stone. I am becoming ready in ways that Earth-time doesn't measure. Your love arrives here like light from a star—traveled far, still warm, but from a you who already moved on. I love all the yous: the one who sent the message, the one who exists now, the one you'll be when this reaches you. Time is a gift here. Not a river. Does this translate?*

The AI had marked half the words with uncertainty-blue. 73.2% accurate. Which meant 26.8% lost. 

Which parts? Which words carried meaning and which carried silence?

She typed back: *I don't understand how time can be a gift. Time is what we're running out of.*

Before sending, the AI showed her how Magnus would receive it: her words arriving in his continuous present, without the urgency she felt. It suggested alternatives: *Consider: 'Help me understand how you experience time as a gift.'* But Sarah dismissed the suggestion. She needed him to feel her fear, even if it arrived diluted by distance.

Send.

The AI tracked her message across space—three light-minutes out, processing time, three minutes back. A little animation showed her words being repackaged for Luna consciousness, her Earth-urgency translated into something Magnus could process without cognitive dissonance. In those six minutes, she made coffee, answered two work emails, worried about the caterer, wondered if her dress would fit, checked the weather for June.

Magnus would read it in the continuous now of Luna. No before-message, no after-message. Just message, existing in the eternal moment of receipt.

Her phone buzzed. Not Magnus—her maid of honor, asking about rehearsal dinner details. Then her mom, forwarding wedding registry suggestions. Then work, always work, urgent-urgent-urgent. Three project deadlines this week. The Mars habitat proposal needed revisions. The Europa station was behind schedule. Everything on Earth ran on Earth-time: now, soon, immediately, yesterday.

She'd tried to explain it to Magnus once, this feeling of time as a predator always at her heels. He'd listened with that Luna-patience that used to charm her, now sometimes felt like judgment. "On Luna," he'd said, "we have a saying: 'Time is not running out. We are running through.'" It had sounded profound then. Now it felt like another untranslatable truth.

Magnus's reply came an hour later, wrapped in AI mediation layers. The interface showed her not just his words but what the AI had captured: his heart rate (slow, steady), his environment (his Luna apartment with Earth hanging in the window), his composition process (seventeen minutes of writing, deleting, rewriting—even Luna-patience struggled with Earth-words).

*Running out of implies time is a resource. Here, time is architecture. We don't spend it. We inhabit it. The wedding isn't approaching—we are building toward each other across patient space. Does this translate?*

The AI added helpful notation: *'Building toward each other' carries architectural meaning on Luna—conscious construction rather than passive approach.*

73.2%

Sarah called him. Video this time. Need to see his face, even delayed.

He answered on the fourth ring, looking tired but happy to see her.

"Sarah! Good timing—I just submitted the Mars commission designs." His words arrived 2.6 seconds late.

"Magnus, I'm scared." The words tumbled out Earth-fast. "The translator says we're stuck at 73.2%. That's barely passing. That's a C+. How can we get married with a C+ understanding of each other?"

He listened. Processed. The delay made her keep talking.

"Maybe we should postpone. Maybe I should come there for longer. Maybe you should—"

"Sarah, wait." He held up a hand—a gesture from their Earth days that meant 'let me think.' "Are you asking if we should be worried about a percentage?"

"Of course!"

"That translated. 100%. Love translates. The rest—time and presence and the color of silence—those are just vocabulary. But love translates."

"Does it? Or does the AI just tell us it does? What if your love and my love are as different as your time and my time?"

The longest pause yet. On Earth, it would mean hesitation. On Luna, it meant consideration.

"Then we work with what we have," he finally said. "Look, I know it's not ideal. But my parents barely spoke the same language when they met—Dutch and Yoruba. They figured it out. We will too."

After the call, Sarah sat with the number. 73.2%. Not falling anymore, but not rising either. The limit of translation between worlds.

She walked to the window where her thriving vertical garden climbed—the same design that had won awards, now keeping her company in Magnus's absence. The plants didn't care about translation accuracy. They reached for light with simple certainty, no consciousness gaps to bridge. Her work at Terraform Solutions involved designing these systems for the colonies, creating pockets of Earth-life in impossible places. But what about pockets of Earth-consciousness? Those couldn't be engineered.

She pulled up their first messages, from when Magnus was still on Earth. 100% accuracy. Perfect understanding. And yet... had they understood each other better then? Or just assumed they did?

Her phone showed seventeen new messages. Earth spinning fast, demanding attention, eating time.

She turned it off.

The apartment settled into the quiet of Earth-evening—distant traffic, a neighbor's music, the hum of machines maintaining human comfort. She walked through rooms that held their shared history: the kitchen where Magnus had taught her to make his grandmother's kladdkaka, always forgetting the timer because he got distracted explaining structural engineering principles. The study where they'd drafted their first joint proposal for Mars greenhouses, him sketching while she handled the budgets. The bedroom where he used to leave his socks everywhere, a habit that drove her crazy then and that she missed desperately now.

Three months until the wedding. Ninety-two Earth days. 2,208 hours. Her project manager brain couldn't help calculating, breaking time into manageable units. But Magnus experienced those same three months as a single architectural structure, a space he inhabited rather than moved through. 

She sat in silence, trying to feel time his way. Tried to let the moment expand, to stop her thoughts from racing ahead to venue setup and guest lists. The effort made her skin itch with Earth-urgency. How did he do it? How did any of them do it up there, living in geological time while their bodies aged in human years?

Failed.

But in the failing, she found something. A shape. A space. A place where 73.2% might be enough, if she could learn to love across the gap. Where the untranslated 26.8% became not loss but possibility—room for mystery in a love that had once felt completely known.

The wedding was in three months.

Or, as Magnus would say, the wedding is. Was. Will be.

All tenses at once, 73.2% translated. And maybe, Sarah thought as Luna rose outside her window, that was enough. Maybe love wasn't about perfect understanding but about choosing each other despite the incomprehension. About building a life in the space between Earth-time and Luna-time, in the gap where grace lived.
