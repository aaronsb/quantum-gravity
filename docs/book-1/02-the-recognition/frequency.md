# Frequency

Dev Patel called his sister on a Thursday. Two years since the dinner where he'd stopped making sense. Since he'd chosen Mars over MIT's PhD program, chosen red horizons over their shared Boston apartment, chosen absence over presence.

Priya had been running protein simulations for sixteen hours straight. Her advisor wanted results by Monday. The lab coffee had turned to acid in her stomach. When Dev's call came through, she almost declined—Mars conversations required energy she didn't have.

But it was 3 AM Mars time. He was calling her in his middle of the night.

"Priya?" His face resolved on her laptop screen. Mars-lag made his smile arrive late. The habitat lighting cast shadows that aged him a decade.

"Dev!" She minimized her lab report, minimized her resentment. "Holy shit, you actually called."

Five years since he'd left. Two since he'd stopped making sense. Six months since their last real conversation, if you could call their mistranslated exchanges real.

"I've been..." He paused. That pause she remembered. But longer now, architectural. "Thinking about waves."

"Waves?" Priya tucked her feet under her in the desk chair. Her dorm room felt suddenly small, the walls too close. "Like ocean waves?"

"Like us waves. You and me waves." His eyes tracked something off-screen. Mars dust storm, maybe. Or the nothing that Mars taught people to see. "We vibrate at different frequencies now."

"That's—" She stopped herself from saying 'ridiculous.' Two years of failed conversations had taught her that Earth-words could wound across space. "Tell me about it."

Dev leaned back. The Mars habitat behind him looked aggressively normal—bed, desk, photos on the wall. Their family portrait from his goodbye party, everyone smiling at futures they couldn't imagine. But the shadows fell wrong. Gravity painted everything with a different brush.

"Do you remember," he said, "when we were kids? That game?"

"Which game?" Though she knew. Could feel it coming like weather.

"Where we'd sit back to back. Try to breathe at the same time."

"God, yes." The memory hurt—summer afternoons in their backyard, two kids trying to sync their hearts. "You always said you could feel my thoughts through my spine."

"I could." No laugh. Statement of fact, Mars-certain. "Can't anymore."

She shifted in her chair. "We're not sitting back to back, Dev. You're literally on another planet."

"No." He shook his head slowly. That new patience that made every gesture profound. "Even if you were here. Or I was there. The frequency is wrong now."

"What frequency?"

He held up his hand. She watched it move—too slow, too careful. Like someone underwater. Or someone who'd forgotten what air meant.

"Watch," he said.

He started tapping. Index finger against thumb. A rhythm.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Slow. Considered. Each tap complete in itself.

"Now you," he said.

She felt ridiculous but copied him. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Her fingers moved Earth-quick, already thinking ahead to the next tap, the next moment, the next everything.

"Faster," he said.

She sped up. Her Earth-fingers moving at Earth-speed. Quick, efficient, impatient with the exercise.

"I can't slow down enough," he said. "You can't speed up enough. We're out of sync."

"It's just lag—"

"It's not lag." He was still tapping, still trying to match her rhythm across impossible distance. "It's frequency. Earth consciousness vibrates at..." He stopped. Looked frustrated. "There's no word. You feel time like—like popcorn. Lots of little explosions."

"And Mars?"

"Mars feels time like sedimentation. Layer after layer. Building." His hand stilled. "I can't think fast enough to be your brother anymore."

The words hit like decompression. Priya felt tears threaten—Earth-quick emotion for Earth-quick loss.

"That's—you're scaring me, Dev."

"I know." His eyes finally met hers through the screen. The same brown eyes she'd inherited from Dad, but looking out from a different universe. "I scare me too. But not the same scare. Your scared is spike-sharp. Mine is...erosion-scared. Slow scared. Patient scared."

"Are you okay? Do you need—what do you need?"

The pause stretched. In it, she heard twenty-five years of shared jokes, shared dreams, shared DNA expressing itself in divergent gravities. Heard the summer afternoons when they'd breathed in sync, thought in sync, been two halves of one thing.

"I need you to know," Dev finally said, "that I love you at my frequency. Even though it doesn't sync with yours anymore. Love you like sediment loves stone. Slow and permanent and—"

"Stop." Priya's Earth-voice cracked. "Just stop. Talk normal. Be normal. Be my brother."

"I am your brother." The certainty in his voice made it worse. "Just not at your speed. Not at your rhythm. I'm your brother the way Mars has water. Had water. Will have water. All tenses at once because time is—"

She slammed the laptop shut.

Sat in her dorm room shaking. Earth-shaking. Quick violent trembles that wanted immediate comfort, instant resolution. The protein simulations blinked on her other screen, molecules folding into inevitable shapes. Everything finding its lowest energy state, just like she'd told their parents.

Just like Dev, settling into Mars frequency. Finding his shape in the silence.

Her phone buzzed. Message from Dev. She almost didn't open it.

*I'm sorry. That's an Earth word but I mean it at Mars depth. I wanted to feel our old frequency one more time. Instead I proved it's gone. Love you, Pri. Love you at the speed of stone.*

She typed back: *Love you too.*

Deleted it.

Typed: *I don't understand what's happening to you.*

Deleted it.

Typed: *Come home.*

Stared at those two words until they blurred. Come home. As if home was a place. As if Dev could fit back into Earth-shaped life. As if frequency was something you could choose instead of something that chose you.

She sent: *I'll try to slow down.*

His response took forty minutes. Or maybe he just thought that long. With Dev now, there was no telling the difference between lag and consideration.

*I'll try to speed up.*

They both knew they were lying. But it was a lie at both frequencies—Earth-quick deception and Mars-slow fiction. Maybe that counted as harmony. Maybe that was all they had left.

Priya opened her laptop. Went back to her lab report on molecular vibrations. Everything in the universe hummed at its own frequency. She'd known that. Had won awards for knowing that. Had built her academic career on understanding how molecules found their resonance.

She just hadn't known it applied to brothers.

Hadn't known that consciousness itself could find a frequency. That gravity could tune the human mind like a fork against stone. That the Dev who'd left for Mars and the Dev who lived there now were the same person vibrating at incompatible speeds.

She worked until dawn, trying to solve proteins while her brother solved time on another world. Neither of them sleeping. Both of them alone at their own frequencies.

In the morning, she'd call their parents. Tell them Dev was fine. Tell them he called. Leave out the rest—the tapping fingers, the patient terror, the love that moved at the speed of stone.

Let them keep their Earth-frequency memories of their Mars-frequency son.

It was the kindest lie she could tell at any speed.
