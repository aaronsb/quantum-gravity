# The Untranslatable Word

The poetry reading was held at New Shanghai University, Earth campus, in the kind of sterile auditorium where dreams went to get tenure. Dr. Keiko Tanaka from Mars was the featured speaker, presenting her collection "Red Silence"—poems that had reportedly crashed three translation algorithms and sent one linguistics professor to therapy.

Mei Chen sat in the third row, her mother Liu beside her. Now sixteen, Mei moved with Mars rhythms that eleven years of Earth doctors couldn't cure—she'd been five when they returned from Mars, old enough for the red planet to have shaped her neural pathways permanently. She'd wanted to come. Needed to come. Had seen the poster and felt something crack open in her chest—a recognition of absence she couldn't name.

Liu had agreed reluctantly. The counselor said exposure therapy might help—surround Mei with Earth stimuli until her neurons remembered their birthright. But watching Mars poetry seemed like the opposite of therapy. Like feeding the drift instead of fighting it.

The auditorium filled with the usual academic suspects: earnest graduate students, bored undergraduates seeking extra credit, faculty who attended everything, and the genuinely curious drawn by rumors of Martian verse that broke translation software. Someone had brought a baby. It cried with Earth-urgency, immediate and demanding.

"Welcome," Dr. Tanaka said. She stood at the podium with stillness that made the air around her seem busy. Forty-three years old according to the program bio, but she moved like someone who'd learned that age was just accumulated patience. "I will read in English, Mandarin, and..." A pause that wasn't hesitation. "Mars."

Someone laughed nervously. Mars wasn't a language. Mars was a place.

"I know what you're thinking," Dr. Tanaka continued. "We speak the same languages on Mars. Use the same words. But words are just vessels. What we pour into them..." She gestured at the space between her hands. "That changes with gravity."

She'd been on Mars for twenty years. Started as a geologist, studying ancient lakebeds. Ended as a poet, studying the absence where lakes had been. Her first collection, "Fossil Water," had won awards on Mars, confused critics on Earth. This was her first Earth reading tour—a test of whether art could translate across consciousness gaps.

Dr. Tanaka opened her book. The pages were mostly white space.

"First poem," she said. "Title translates as 'Morning.' But that's wrong. Morning is Earth concept—sun rising, day beginning, linear time advancing. Mars has—" She stopped. Looked at the audience with eyes that had seen different sunrises. "I'll just read."

She began in English:

"The absence wakes before the presence,
Shadow withdraws revealing stone—"

Then Mandarin, the same words but different weight. Then she opened her mouth and made a sound that wasn't quite speech. A soft exhalation that became a whisper that became silence that somehow continued.

In the third row, Mei leaned forward. Her hands gripped the armrests like she was falling upward.

"What was that?" someone called out. A professor type, annoyed by the performance.

"The word," Dr. Tanaka said, "for the space between night and not-night. Where darkness doesn't become light but admits it was never complete dark. English has no—Mandarin has no—Earth has no equivalent."

She read another poem. This time when the untranslatable word came, she held her hand up, palm out, fingers spread. The gesture meant something Mei almost understood. Like a memory of a dream of a place she'd been before she was born.

Liu watched her daughter's face transform. Recognition without comprehension. Like seeing a childhood photo of someone you'd never met but knowing it was family. She wanted to grab Mei, drag her out, protect her from this gravitational pull toward absence. But Mei was already gone, leaning into the Mars-words like a plant toward strange sun.

"The translator says 'sorrow,'" Dr. Tanaka continued, reading from her third poem. "But it's not sorrow. It's—" She made another sound. Hollow but not empty. An absence with architecture. "It's the shape left when water forgets how to be water. The memory of fullness in a dry riverbed. Earth sadness moves. This doesn't move. This acknowledges."

A student raised her hand. "Can you teach us? The words?"

"No." Simple as gravity. "Your throat is wrong. Your silence is wrong. You breathe Earth air with Earth lungs thinking Earth thoughts. The words are possible only when absence has weight. When silence has color. When—"

"When you're broken," someone muttered. The professor again, defensive now.

Dr. Tanaka turned toward the voice. Her movement had strange physics—too slow, too complete.

"Not broken," she said. "Attuned to different music. Earth consciousness is symphony—many instruments, much noise, beautiful chaos. Mars consciousness is...one string vibrating in vast space. Both music. Different music."

She read more poems. Each one had gaps where Earth-words failed. The audience grew restless, frustrated. They'd come for poetry and found philosophy. Found incomprehension. The baby cried again, its mother bouncing it with Earth-rhythm that only made it worse.

But Mei understood. Not the words—the words were impossible. But the space around them. The pause that meant more than speech. The gesture that carried what voice couldn't.

During the Q&A, Liu raised her hand. The question came out before she could stop it: "My daughter was born on Mars. Came to Earth young. She seems—between. Can you help her?"

Dr. Tanaka looked at Mei. Really looked. The kind of seeing that took time. That acknowledged the person completely before responding.

"What's your name?"

"Mei."

"Mei." She said it differently. Not mispronunciation—a different relationship to the sound. Like the name was a stone she was examining for fossils. "Do you dream in red?"

Mei nodded. Her mother made a sound—surprise or fear.

"Do you wake in the space between sleep and not-sleep?"

Another nod.

"Do you find Earth words..." Dr. Tanaka paused, searching. "Crowded?"

"Yes." The word escaped Mei like atmosphere. "Yes. They're all touching. No space between. No room to think."

"Then you know—" Dr. Tanaka made the first sound again. The word that wasn't word. The meaning that Earth couldn't hold.

And Mei did know. Knew it like bone-deep memory. Like the taste of water that wasn't there. Like home that existed in the space between homes. Her eyes filled with tears—not sadness but recognition. The relief of being seen.

"Yes," Mei whispered. Then made a sound—not quite the same as Dr. Tanaka's, but related. A cousin-word. An Earth throat trying to speak Mars truth.

The auditorium was quiet. Liu reached for her daughter's hand, but Mei had already pulled inward, into the space where Mars-words lived.

After the reading, in the lobby, Dr. Tanaka approached them through the crowd.

"Your daughter," she said to Liu, "is lucky."

"Lucky?" Liu's voice cracked. "She barely speaks. She draws absences. Her teachers think—"

"She's bilingual," Dr. Tanaka interrupted. "Conscious in two frequencies. It's hard now. Will get harder. But someday, when Earth needs to speak to Mars, truly speak, not just exchange words—she'll be the bridge."

She handed Mei a slim book. Handwritten. More white space than text. "Practice," she said. "The words you can't say. Draw them. Dance them. Dream them. They're yours too."

Mei clutched the book against her chest. Inside, she knew, were the shapes of thoughts she'd never been able to explain. The pause that meant everything. The silence that sang.

"Thank you," she said in English. Then made a gesture—hand to chest, fingers spreading outward. A movement that meant gratitude in the language that wasn't language.

Dr. Tanaka smiled and returned it. Then added something—a tilt of the head, a shift in stance. Mei understood: *You're not alone.*

Liu didn't understand the exchange. But she recognized goodbye in any language. Even languages that weren't. She watched her daughter hold the book like a lifeline, already reading the white spaces between words.

In the car home, Mei was silent. But it was a different silence than before. Not empty—occupied. She was reading the gift, running her fingers over handwritten Mars-words that looked like breathing exercises, like musical notation, like maps to nowhere.

"What does it say?" Liu asked, trying to bridge.

Mei looked up. Her eyes held that new distance, but also something else. Compassion for her Earth-bound mother who could only think in touching words.

"It says I'm not broken," Mei said. "Just tuned to different music."

She made a sound then—one of the Mars-words. It hung in the car between them like a confession, like a promise, like a goodbye to the Earth-girl Mei had tried to be.

Liu drove through Shanghai traffic, surrounded by Earth-urgent horns and Earth-bright lights, carrying her Mars-touched daughter home. The space between them had a new shape now. Not empty—inhabited.

By words that couldn't be said.

By understanding that couldn't be shared.

By love that persisted anyway, stubborn as gravity, patient as stone.
