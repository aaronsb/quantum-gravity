# Coffee on Luna

Marcus Chen had been awake for thirty-seven hours when the Luna shuttle finally docked. The Hong Kong markets had crashed at 3 AM Earth-time, taking his firm's emerging tech portfolio with them. He'd lost forty million dollars of other people's money in the span between his second and third coffee, watching numbers turn red on screens that never slept. Kepler Mining Corp waited on Luna with a deal that could save everything—if he could think clearly enough to close it.

If he could think clearly enough to close it.

Marcus pressed his thumb against the dispensing pad—Earth-quick, the barista would note later—and watched the dark stream fill his cup. Steam rose in the low gravity, twisting into shapes that lasted too long. Everything here lasted too long.

"First time?" The barista's words arrived with the patience of stone weathering. She was young, maybe twenty-five, but spoke with the cadence of centuries.

"Business trip." Marcus lifted the cup, inhaled. The beans were Ethiopian, authentic, imported at absurd expense. The water was recycled but pure. The temperature was precise. "Smells right."

"Smells are." She cleaned an already-clean counter with movements that had no urgency. "Taste is."

Is what? Marcus wanted to ask, but she'd already turned to the next customer, an older man who ordered without speaking. They understood each other in the space between words.

The café overlooked Mare Imbrium through a window that had watched the same view for sixty years. Earth hung in the black, a blue marble that never moved. Marcus found a table and sat, cupping the coffee between his palms.

First sip. 

The flavor hit—rich, bitter, with notes of chocolate and earth. His tongue recognized every molecule. His brain catalogued each familiar sensation. But somewhere between taste and meaning, something shifted. The coffee became a question his mouth couldn't answer.

He took another sip, then another, chasing something that remained stubbornly absent from the perfect coffee.

At the next table, two Luna natives shared breakfast in silence. Not awkward silence—Marcus knew that kind. This was architectural, built and inhabited. They looked at each other occasionally, long gazes that held entire conversations. One smiled. The other continued eating. The smile was still happening somehow, though the lips had moved on.

Marcus checked his phone. Fourteen messages from Earth in the hour since he'd landed. He thumbed through them:
- Janet confirming dinner Thursday
- Mom asking about the flight  
- His assistant with three urgent and two critical items
- A meme from his brother

The urgency felt thin, stretched like atmosphere between worlds. Thursday dinner with Janet became abstract—a plan made by someone who'd lived in Earth's demanding now.

"How is?" The barista appeared at his elbow. When had she moved?

"It's perfect." Marcus heard himself say it from a distance. "Exactly like home."

"Yes." She refilled his cup without being asked. The stream fell slowly, too slowly. "Exactly like."

Like what? But she was gone again, moving between tables with the unhurried purpose of tides.

Marcus lifted the fresh cup, finding it still perfect in every measurable way and still fundamentally wrong. He thought about asking someone, but what would he say? The coffee tastes like coffee but means something else? 

His phone buzzed with another message from Janet: *Miss you already! Can't wait to hear about the moon!*

He started to type: *It's strange here. The coffee—*

Deleted it.

Typed: *Miss you too. Everything's fine.*

Deleted that.

Stared at the blinking cursor. What was he trying to say? That gravity had a flavor? That silence had weight? That everyone here moved like they were listening to music he couldn't hear?

A child at a corner table drew in a sketchbook. Marcus watched her make long, careful marks. The drawing took shape—not an image but a pattern. Circles within circles, each one perfect, each one patient. Her mother watched Earth through the window, unblinking. They shared the same profound stillness.

Marcus's phone rang. Earth-loud in the Luna quiet. Every head turned, not in annoyance but curiosity. Like watching an alien artifact activate.

"Hello?" His voice cracked the air.

"Marc! How's the moon? Low gravity must be wild!" Dave, his business partner, practically vibrating through the connection.

"It's—" Marcus looked at his coffee, at the patient barista, at the child drawing endless circles. "Different."

"Different good or different bad? Never mind, tell me when you're back. Listen, I need you to look at the Kimura proposal. I know you just landed but—"

"Dave." The name felt sharp in his mouth. "I need to go."

"Go? Go where? You're in a space hotel!"

Where indeed? Marcus ended the call and turned off his phone. The café settled back into its rhythm. Someone laughed—a sound that started now and would finish in its own time.

He drank his coffee and watched Earth hang motionless in the sky. The taste was perfect. Exactly what coffee should taste like. But the spaces between each sip grew longer, filled with something he couldn't name. The absence of hurry. The presence of duration. The weight of nothing at all.

When he finally left, the barista nodded. A greeting and farewell collapsed into one gesture.

"Come back," she said. Or maybe "Come. Back." The pause changed everything.

Outside, Marcus walked the corridors of Luna Station, his Earth-quick stride gradually slowing. His phone stayed off. Thursday dinner became a concept from another life, urgent and critical things dissolved into the patient air.

The coffee taste lingered on his tongue, and he realized it wasn't loneliness he was tasting but something else entirely. Something that would take longer than a business trip to understand. Something that had already begun to change the shape of his thoughts, one sip at a time.

He had three days on Luna. By the end, he'd need thirteen days. Then thirty.

Then forever.

But that was later. For now, he just walked, tasting coffee and absence, learning the flavor of time.
