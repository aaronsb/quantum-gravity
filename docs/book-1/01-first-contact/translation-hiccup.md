# Translation Hiccup

Sarah Okafor had catalogued seventeen ways Magnus's messages had changed since he'd moved to Luna.

First: the emoji disappeared. Hearts and smiles that once punctuated every text, gone like atmospheric moisture. Second: his sentences grew patience she couldn't match. Third: the questions stopped—not rudely, but as if questioning had become unnecessary in Luna's eternal present.

She sat in their Amsterdam apartment—her apartment now, though she still paid half-rent on his Luna studio out of principle or denial—scrolling through two years of message history. Watching their love decay in real-time data points.

They'd met at a sustainable architecture conference in Singapore three years ago. Magnus—tall, with his Nigerian mother's cheekbones and his Dutch father's pale eyes—presenting his thesis on 'patient buildings' that evolved with their inhabitants. Sarah showcasing her vertical garden systems for Terraform Solutions. He'd knocked over her coffee reaching for a brochure, spent the next hour helping rebuild her display, his Dutch accent thickening with concentration. She'd fallen for his laugh first—Earth-bright and immediate. They'd moved to Amsterdam together eight months later, found the apartment with its perfect morning light and tiny balcony where her plants could thrive.

The translation overlay had started as a joke. "TransLingua Premium: For Love Across Space!" Targeted ads that knew too much about her search history. Magnus had laughed when she'd subscribed. "We don't need that. Love is its own language."

But love, Sarah was learning, spoke different dialects at different gravities.

"Tell me about your day," she said into the screen. Earth evening, Luna morning. Their synchronized schedule after two years of practice, penciled into her calendar like a medical appointment. Necessary. Chronic.

Magnus's face pixelated, reformed. The lag was 1.3 seconds each way—speed of light plus processing. She'd learned to wait, to let conversations breathe. But tonight something else delayed his words.

"I participated in duration." The translation overlay flickered blue, uncertain. "I mean—I experienced. No. I..." He switched to Mandarin, then back to English. "There's no word."

"Try," Sarah said, aiming for their old playfulness. "Use five words if you need one."

"I was present through time."

"Like meditation?" She pulled her knees up, making herself small in the chair they'd bought together at the Waterlooplein flea market.

"No. Yes. But not—" His frustration looked different at one-sixth gravity. Gentler. Everything was gentler there. "Sarah, do you remember when we met?"

"Of course. The conference in Singapore. You spilled coffee on my poster." The memory hurt—sharp and immediate. Earth memories did that, stabbed quick and withdrew.

"I spilled coffee." He repeated it like a foreign phrase. "The coffee left me and found you."

Sarah's smile faltered. "Are you okay? You sound—"

"I sound Earth-wrong." Not a question. "I know. I hear it too."

The AI mediator had cost three hundred euros a month. TransLingua's premium service, designed for cross-gravity relationships. "More than translation," the ads promised. "Complete experiential packaging." The AI sat between them like an invisible therapist, catching her Earth-urgency and his Luna-patience, trying to repackage each for the other's consciousness. But even AI had limits. Some gaps were too wide for algorithms to bridge.

"How was your day?" Magnus asked. The AI held the question for 1.3 seconds, analyzing his tone, the way he leaned forward slightly, the Luna-specific pause before 'day.' It added context for Sarah: *He's asking about your experiential flow, not just activities.* But Sarah was already responding in Earth-time, and the AI scrambled to keep up.

"Good! Finished the Morrison project. You remember, the sustainable housing initiative? They loved the vertical garden concept. Oh, and Jenny says hi. We had lunch at that place you like—liked. The Ethiopian restaurant on Overtoom." She heard herself accelerating, trying to beam her life into his awareness before the connection failed. "Oh, and I found our song on an old playlist—"

"Sarah." Just her name, but the AI mediator marked it blue on her screen. *Uncertainty detected. Possible meaning drift.* A small note appeared: *On Luna, names increasingly carry temporal weight—not just who you are but when you are.*

"What?"

"You're speaking very quickly."

She wasn't. She was speaking Earth-normal. But the lag made her count: seven sentences in the time it took him to say her name. When had their rhythms diverged so completely?

"Sorry. I'll slow down."

"No, I—" He touched his temple. Luna-slow, she thought, then hated herself for thinking it. "I enjoy your velocity. It reminds me of rain."

"Rain?"

"Many things happening at once, too fast to catch individually." He smiled. "Beautiful chaos."

*Beautiful chaos.* The phrase lodged in her chest. Is that what she was to him now? Weather to be observed from safe distance?

"The wedding planning is coming along," she said, trying for normal. "The venue confirmed for June. That canal-side place in Jordaan we loved."

Three seconds out. Three seconds back. In the gap, she watched his face process not just her words but their speed, their assumption of shared urgency.

"June." He tasted the word. "Five months Earth-time."

"Or 146 days. Or 3,504 hours. Or—" She caught herself babbling, filling space he seemed comfortable leaving empty. "However you want to count it."

"On Luna we count differently." Blue flicker on 'count.' "Time feels... thicker here. More substantial. June is..." He paused, searching for words that would translate. "It feels both immediate and distant."

"What does that mean?"

"It means—" Magnus looked away, toward his apartment's window where Earth hung like a blue ornament. "It means I love you in Earth-time but live in Luna-time, and the translation is failing."

The words hit like decompression. Sarah felt her carefully constructed optimism crack, air rushing out.

"The translation is fine. We're fine." She heard her own voice accelerate, trying to outrun the implication. "It's just—we knew distance would be hard. But love is love, right? That translates."

Six seconds of silence. Their most expensive conversation yet.

"You said 'love is love.'" Magnus rubbed his eyes—a gesture she recognized from when he was deep in a design problem. "But I'm starting to think love is shaped by where we are. On Earth it moves fast, like rain. Here it's more like... like the foundations I design. Solid, slow to build."

"But what? Are you—are you breaking up with me?" The words tumbled out Earth-fast, Earth-messy, Earth-afraid.

"Breaking?" Blue flicker. "No, no. That's not—" He pressed his palm to the screen. An old gesture from their early calls. She matched it, pixels apart. "I love you, Sarah. God, I love you. But something is happening to how I experience things. The distance isn't just physical anymore."

"Far?"

"No. Here is different."

After the call, Sarah sat in their apartment surrounded by wedding magazines and vendor contracts. The translation app helpfully provided a transcript, blue uncertainty markers scattered like bruises through their conversation.

She scrolled to their first calls. No blue. Perfect translation for months. When had it started? When had Magnus's words begun resisting Earth-shaped meanings?

Her phone buzzed. A message from him, sent at Luna-speed, considered and crafted:

*I will marry you in June. This is certain as orbit. But I need you to know: the person you marry will have learned Luna-patience. I am becoming someone you haven't met yet. Someone who loves you from a different gravity.*

*Is that enough?*

Sarah typed seventeen responses. Deleted them all. Earth-words, Earth-quick, Earth-desperate. Finally sent:

*I don't know. But I want to find out.*

She looked up the price of a Luna ticket. One-way was cheaper. The algorithm knew something she was only beginning to understand: the hardest journey wasn't there.

It was back.

She opened her laptop, began researching. Not Luna travel sites, but something else. Academic papers on consciousness drift. Support groups for cross-gravity couples. Testimony from families pulled apart by more than distance.

The numbers were stark. Relationships with one partner on Luna: 73% failure rate after two years. Mars: 81%. The ones that survived had adapted, evolved, found new ways to love across consciousness gaps.

Or they'd moved. One way or another.

Sarah closed the laptop. Looked around the apartment they'd chosen together, back when together meant the same thing to both of them. His coffee mug still sat by the sink. His architecture books still lined the shelves. His absence still shaped the space.

Outside, Amsterdam's canals reflected the evening light. Boats passed with Earth-urgency, carrying people to Earth-important places. She'd loved this city with Magnus. Now she lived in it alone, even when he was on the screen.

Tomorrow she'd cancel the venue. Or book a Luna ticket. Or both. Or neither.

Tonight, she just sat with the translation failure. With love that meant rain to her and stone to him. With the beautiful, terrible distance between Earth-urgent and Luna-patient.

With the growing certainty that some gaps couldn't be bridged.

Only inhabited.
