# What We Don't Say

The Patel family dinner happened every Sunday at 6 PM Earth-standard. Even when Dev was on Mars. Especially when Dev was on Mars.

Priya checked the connection quality for the third time. Twenty-minute delay each way to Mariner Valley. The family's AI mediator was already active, its interface showing four video feeds offset by lightspeed lag. She'd written a script to overlay timestamps on everyone's video feeds—her contribution to making the impossible possible. But the real work happened in the AI layer, where Earth-urgent family love got translated into something Dev's Mars-patience could receive. Mom had made samosas, Dev's favorite, as if he could smell them across 225 million kilometers. Dad had opinions about cricket that needed sharing. Dev had... distance.

Three years had passed since Dev had taken the position at Mariner Valley as a mineralogist, his eyes bright with Earth dreams about Mars futures. Now he studied rocks that had never known rain, mapping the history of a planet that failed to live.

"Can everyone see?" Mom adjusted her screen with the particular fussing of a mother who'd lost a son to space but refused to admit it. The kitchen behind her looked exactly as it had when Dev left. Same yellow walls. Same hanging plants. Same denial.

Dad nodded from his study, surrounded by the tax documents he brought home even on Sundays. Earth work for Earth clients who needed Earth-speed solutions. Priya waved from her MIT dorm room, where biochemistry textbooks competed for space with musical scores—her dual major spreading across every surface, equations and compositions equally demanding her time.

Dev's face pixelated into focus from Mars, already mid-response to something they'd said twenty minutes ago. The AI showed his current state in a sidebar—heart rate: 52 bpm, attention: diffuse, consciousness: 67% Mars-integrated. The habitat behind him was all functional surfaces and recycled air aesthetics. He'd lost weight. Or maybe gravity had lost him.

"Looking good, beta," Mom lied cheerfully. The same lie every week. The same hope that repetition would make it true.

They began eating. Four plates, four time zones, one family tradition held together by bandwidth and maternal will. The AI worked constantly, packaging Mom's rapid-fire concerns into patient bundles, stretching Dev's sparse responses into something that felt like participation, adding context notes like *His silence contains affection, not absence.*

"Priya, how's biochemistry?" Dad asked between bites of dal.

"Brutal. But I think I finally understand protein folding." She launched into an explanation, her words tumbling over each other in familiar Earth-rapids. The Patel family curse: too many thoughts, too little time. "The way molecules find their shapes is like—like music finding its key. Everything wants to settle into its lowest energy state."

Mom smiled, Dad nodded, everyone performed the dance of Sunday dinner. The comfortable rhythm of Earth conversation: statement, response, interruption, laughter, overlap. A chaos Dev used to conduct with jokes and gentle teasing.

Except Dev wasn't eating.

He held his fork—had been holding it since they started. On Earth, Mom would have noticed immediately. But through the screen, across the void, his stillness registered as lag.

The conversations braided and frayed. Earth moved at Earth-speed. Mars moved at Mars-speed. The AI translator did its best, adding timestamps and attempting to weave coherence from chaos. Priya watched the color-coded timeline on her second monitor: blue for Dev's words arriving from the past, green for responses to questions not yet asked, red for the places where meaning fell through gaps.

"Are you eating enough?" Mom asked. The eternal question, now with interplanetary delay.

Dev's response would arrive in twenty minutes. By then, they'd have moved through three other topics. But Mom asked anyway, every week, sending her motherhood into the void like a prayer.

"Remember when we used to cook together?" Priya said, filling the space. "Dev always added too much chili."

"Still does," Mom said, present tense for her absent son. "I send him care packages. Spices, dried mango, those cookies he likes. They take four months to arrive."

Twenty minutes after Mom's question, Dev lifted his fork. Put it down. "The food here tastes like archaeology."

"Like what?" Dad leaned toward the screen, but Dev was already responding to Priya's protein explanation from the past: "The folding is beautiful. Like origami made of absence."

"That doesn't even make sense," Priya said, though he wouldn't hear her for another twenty minutes.

The delay made everything true and false simultaneously. They were having dinner together. They were eating alone. Dev was fine. Dev was transforming into something unrecognizable. The family was whole. The family was scattered across space-time like light through a prism.

"How's the research?" Dad asked into the void.

Twenty minutes later: "We found water. Old water. It remembers being ice."

"Water doesn't remember," Priya said reflexively.

Twenty minutes later: "Earth water doesn't. Mars water holds grudges. Keeps secrets. Knows it failed to make oceans. Every molecule here is disappointed."

Mom's smile flickered. "You're being poetic."

But Dev was answering something else now: "I dream in rust. Iron oxide paintings on the inside of my eyelids. Sometimes I forget Earth has colors that aren't red."

"You need to come home for a visit," Dad said. "It's been too long."

The suggestion traveled to Mars. Waited. Returned transformed.

"Home," Dev said, testing the word. "I don't... When I think of home now, I see it from outside. Like Earth is something I visit in memory. A blue marble in the black. Beautiful but... distant. Like love letters from someone I used to be."

"Dev—" Mom started.

"I'm happy here," he said to a question she hadn't asked. "It's just a different kind of happy. Not active. More like... recognition. Like finding your frequency in the silence."

"I don't understand," Priya said, though he was already responding to something else.

"The sunsets here last forever," Dev continued. "Not poetic. Literal. The dust makes everything gentle. Even the sun dying looks patient. I watch them from the observation dome. Alone but not... not lonely. Just alone. There's a difference but I can't—" He stopped. Looked frustrated. "I can't explain in Earth words anymore."

"You're scaring Mom," Priya said to the void.

Twenty minutes later, Dev laughed. But it was Mars laughter—delayed, considered, arriving after the moment had passed.

"I should go," he finally said. To which moment? Which conversation? Which version of his family still traveling toward him at light speed?

"But we just started," Mom protested to the Dev of twenty minutes ago.

"Started. Yes." He almost smiled. "We're always just starting. That's the—" He stopped. Looked at his untouched plate. "I love you all. Present tense. Past tense. Future tense. All at once, which is impossible on Earth but mandatory on Mars."

"Next Sunday?" Mom asked. "Same time?"

"Same time," Dev agreed, though time meant different things now.

After he disconnected, the Earth-bound Patels sat with their screens and plates. Mom's samosas had gone cold. Dad's opinions about cricket had faded. Priya's code still sprawled across her monitors, trying to solve the unsolvable.

"He seems..." Mom searched for words.

"Different," Priya supplied.

"Lonely," Dad said.

They were all right and all wrong, missing the point that drifted somewhere between Earth and Mars in the space where their son and brother was becoming someone they loved but couldn't quite recognize.

"I'll message him," Priya decided. "Later. When he's... when it's morning there."

But later never came—or perhaps it came too soon, or arrived exactly when it should but meant something different by the time it reached them.

That night, Priya worked on her code. A new translation algorithm. Not for words but for time itself. A way to braid conversations across light-speed delays. To be together despite the fundamental impossibility of together.

She worked until dawn, Earth-time. On Mars, Dev might be watching another patient sunset. Or sleeping, dreaming in rust. Or standing at his workstation, studying rocks that remembered being ocean floor on a planet that forgot how to live.

The code would never work. Some distances couldn't be programmed away.

But she wrote it anyway. Because that's what love looked like at light-speed. Impossible gestures sent into the void. Hoping something, anything, would echo back.

Even if the echo came too late to matter.

Even if the echo came back changed.

The next Sunday, Dev's chair was empty. He sent a message: "Participating in duration today. Think of me yesterday."

The AI translated it perfectly.

No one understood a word.
