## What This First Book Accomplishes

**Establishes**:
- The core concept of consciousness drift
- Earth-Mars-Luna triangle only
- 2-3 families tracked across 30 years
- AI as background presence
- The liminal horror/beauty

**Saves for Later Books**:
- Other colonies (Proxima, Belt, etc.)
- Deep AI perspective
- Political implications
- Later generation complete breakdown
- Any attempt at solutions

## Character Throughlines

## Tight Thematic Arc

**Beginning**: "Something feels off" → **Middle**: "We're becoming alien to each other" → **End**: "This is who we are now"

## Word Count Target
- 12 stories × 5,000 average = 60,000 words
- Tight, focused, single-sitting readable
- No wasted exposition or worldbuilding

## The Promise to Readers

This first book delivers:
1. Complete emotional arc
2. Clear understanding of consciousness drift  
3. Investment in 2-3 families
4. The liminal horror/beauty experience
5. Satisfaction without resolution

## Why This Structure Works

- **Focused**: Only Earth-Mars-Luna dynamics
- **Personal**: 2-3 families, not civilization-wide
- **Accessible**: 30-year span, relatable timeline
- **Complete**: Full emotional journey
- **Open**: Room for expansion without requiring it

## Remember

We're not trying to tell the whole story of humanity's divergence. We're telling the story of a few families discovering they're becoming beautifully, tragically alien to each other. Everything else can wait for future books.
