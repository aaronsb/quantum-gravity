# Following Guidelines

Medic Ytal-9 completed their post-shift analysis. Today: seven patients treated, five optimal outcomes, two non-viable. Efficiency rating: Above standard. 

The Earth child's case warranted documentation. Unusual progression from functional/non-critical to critical-state/non-viable within 3.7 hours. Ytal-9 uploaded their sensor data for training purposes.

"Medic Ytal-9," Supervisor Khet-1 approached. "The Earth child's guardian has filed a complaint. They claim negligence."

Negligence. The term translated clearly: failure-to-act/protocol-violation. 

"Review my actions," Ytal-9 offered their data pad. "All protocols followed precisely."

Khet-1 scanned the record. Three critical-state patients had required immediate intervention during the Earth child's non-critical period. Triage protocol clear: critical before non-critical. No violations detected.

"The guardian is emotional-state/impaired," Khet-1 diagnosed. "Earth consciousness often conflicts with medical reality."

Ytal-9 agreed. They had observed the Earth mother's increasing agitation as they prioritized dying patients over her sensing-discomfort child. Emotional attachment clouding medical judgment—a common Earth failing.

"However," Khet-1 continued, "review this anomaly."

The supervisor highlighted the moment of transition. The Earth child's shift from non-critical to critical showed an unusual pattern. Where Proxima children displayed binary state changes—functional to non-functional—this child had degraded gradually.

"Interesting," Ytal-9 studied the data. "Their pain responses appear to compound systemically."

"Pain?" Khet-1 processed the Earth term. The translation offered: sensation-data/non-terminal. "You mean their sensor feedback."

"Yes. The sensor feedback intensity increased steadily, then triggered systemic failure."

Ytal-9 felt what Proxima consciousness allowed: intellectual curiosity. Here was a medical puzzle. Earth physiology responded to non-critical sensation as if it were critical. Inefficient design, but medically relevant.

"I saved two critical patients during the child's non-critical phase," Ytal-9 noted. "Had I addressed non-critical sensation first, those patients would have ceased. The child still had 3.7 hours of functional time."

"Correct assessment," Khet-1 confirmed. "Though perhaps Earth patients require modified protocols. Their inefficient pain processing creates vulnerabilities."

Ytal-9 filed this insight. In their quarters that evening, they studied Earth medical texts. The concept of "suffering" appeared frequently but remained opaque. Earth seemed to conflate physical sensation with existential states. Primitive, but relevant for treatment optimization.

A message waited on their personal pad. The Earth mother had sent something before departing. Ytal-9 opened it, expecting medical data or formal complaints.

A child's drawing filled the screen. Chaotic colors, no binary clarity. Earth rendered in impossible swirls, with stick figures holding hands around it. Ytal-9 struggled to parse the purpose. Decorative? Educational?

The text below read: "For the doctor. To remember Earth by."

Ytal-9 translated: Data for medical-professional. Earth-information for memory-storage.

They saved it to their medical files under "Earth Physiology - Visual Reference." Useful for understanding Earth's chaotic consciousness patterns. The small symbol beside the text—a misshapen circle with protrusions—likely indicated orbital mechanics or gravitational fields.

Three weeks later, treating another Earth child, Ytal-9 noticed similar pain-cascade patterns developing. This time, they acted at 2.1 hours into the non-critical phase, preventing system failure. The child survived.

"Excellent adaptation," Khet-1 praised. "You've improved Earth patient outcomes by 12%."

Ytal-9 felt satisfaction—clean, binary. They had identified a pattern and modified treatment accordingly. The Earth parents' gratitude seemed excessive, but emotional dysregulation was expected from their consciousness type.

That night, Ytal-9 reviewed the saved drawing again. The chaotic swirls remained incomprehensible, but they had proven diagnostically useful. Earth's disorder had its own patterns, hidden in the noise.

They added a note to the file: "Earth child, age 7, provided useful medical data before cessation. Recommend collecting similar visual data from Earth patients for pattern analysis."

In the morgue records, Lily Kim was listed as: Earth-origin, pediatric, non-viable despite intervention. Cause: Unusual pain-cascade syndrome. Lesson learned: Earth patients require preemptive sensation management.

Ytal-9 had followed every guideline perfectly. That the guidelines themselves couldn't translate Earth suffering into Proxima understanding wasn't a medical failure. It was simply a fact, binary and absolute.

The child had been functional, then critical, then non-viable. The mother had been rational, then emotional, then absent. The drawing remained in the files—chaos given form, Earth compressed into data, a heart that meant nothing at all.

Ytal-9 prepared for tomorrow's shift. More patients to sort: viable/non-viable, critical/stable. The binary clarity of service, unmarred by Earth's messy gradients. They had learned to save Earth children by treating their sensation-data as pseudo-critical. 

It was, they believed, what the ceased child's data had been meant to teach.
