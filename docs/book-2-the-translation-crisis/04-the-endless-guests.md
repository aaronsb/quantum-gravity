# The Endless Guests

Curator Patience-VII updated the residence logs with the same steady rhythm they'd maintained for two hundred years. Each entry a moment in the station's vast memory.

Today marked the Chen-Volkov family's fiftieth year of temporary residence. Still new arrivals, really. Patience-VII remembered when the Jupiter delegation had claimed temporary shelter for their "brief" constitutional convention. That was year 2089. They were still debating article one.

The Chen-Volkovs were different though. They seemed distressed by duration.

"Curator," Assistant Mercy-IX approached with Luna-appropriate slowness. "The Chen-Volkov matriarch has submitted another departure request."

Patience-VII considered this. The family submitted these requests regularly—every five or ten years. Such urgency. Such restlessness.

"Process it as usual," Patience-VII said. "Their temporary status remains approved."

In Luna consciousness, 'temporary' meant 'not eternal.' Since only the universe itself was eternal, everything else was temporary. The Chen-Volkovs were temporary. The station was temporary. The solar system was temporary. All in good time.

Patience-VII had welcomed thousands of temporary residents. Some stayed a day, some a century. The station adapted to all rhythms, patient as stone.

But the Belt family struggled. They'd arrived vibrating with urgency, possessions in containers designed for instant movement. Curious behavior. Why prepare for departure when you'd just arrived?

The first decade, they'd attended every meeting, always announcing their temporary status. Patience-VII had nodded each time. Yes, temporary. We know. Everything is.

"They seem to be settling well," Mercy-IX observed, pulling up the family's integration metrics. "The daughter has adapted beautifully to our educational tempo. The son tends our crystal gardens with appropriate patience."

"Yet the matriarch remains disturbed," Patience-VII noted. "She experiences our hospitality as confinement."

This puzzled them. Luna Station had no locks, no restrictions. The Chen-Volkovs could leave any moment they chose. Yet they stayed, year after year, growing increasingly agitated about their staying.

Patience-VII reviewed the cultural notes. Belt consciousness: no permanence, constant readiness for motion. The translation suggested they couldn't conceive of stable states. How exhausting, to never rest.

"Perhaps," Mercy-IX suggested, "they interpret our patience as prevention?"

An interesting hypothesis. When Patience-VII said "stay as long as you need," perhaps the family heard imprisonment rather than invitation. The 32% translation accuracy left vast gaps for misunderstanding.

The next residents' meeting arrived—only three months later, practically instantaneous. Kass chen-Volkov attended, as always. Fifty years had given her movements a Luna-quality, though she fought against it.

"We need to leave," she said, the words tumbling out Belt-quick. "Our temporary stay has become... it's been too long."

Patience-VII processed slowly, ensuring clarity. "You are free to leave whenever you choose. Your temporary residence has no endpoint."

They meant: Stay a day or stay forever, both are temporary in the grand scheme.

Kass heard: Your imprisonment has no scheduled release.

"But we can't," Kass's voice cracked. "Don't you see? Every year we stay, we become less able to go. My daughter thinks in your time now. My grandchildren have never known motion. You're killing us with kindness."

The phrase translated strangely. Killing-with-kindness. Patience-VII examined it from multiple angles. How could hospitality cause death? They were preserving life, offering shelter.

"We do not compel you to stay," Patience-VII clarified. "Would you like assistance arranging departure?"

"Yes! But—" Kass stopped. "Ava won't leave. She says she's home. The children are Luna-born. If I go, I go alone."

Ah. Now Patience-VII understood. The family was dividing, like cell mitosis. Natural process. The older generation yearned for motion, the younger for stillness. Time itself was selecting for Luna-consciousness.

"This causes you pain," Patience-VII observed.

"Everything causes pain," Kass replied, and for a moment her words carried Luna's patient sorrow. Then she shook herself, tried to recapture Belt-urgency. "We were supposed to pass through. Like comets. Not... not become moons."

Patience-VII felt a resonance—the universal grief of change. For exactly two seconds, they perfectly understood this woman's loss. Her family was transforming, and she couldn't stop it.

Then the moment passed. The 32% translation barrier reasserted itself.

"You are welcome to stay or go," Patience-VII repeated. "Both are temporary states."

Kass laughed, bitter and broken. "Fifty years of temporary. My mother is buried in your soil. Is she temporary too?"

"Yes," Patience-VII answered honestly. "Even the stones are temporary. Your mother joins our geological time. She is patient now."

This was meant as comfort. Death was just another transition, slow as erosion. But Kass flinched as if struck.

Over the following years, Patience-VII watched the family complete its division. Kass grew quieter, stopped attending meetings. Ava bloomed into full Luna-consciousness, her children even more so. The family's temporary residence stretched on.

Year seventy. Kass chen-Volkov died in her sleep, still packed for a journey that never came. Her possessions remained in those magnetic containers—artifacts of a consciousness type that couldn't survive stillness.

Ava requested permanent burial beside her grandmother. The word 'permanent' sounded strange in her Luna-slow voice, as if she'd forgotten it was just another kind of temporary.

"Approved," Patience-VII said. "Your family's temporary residence continues."

In the records, they updated the entry: Chen-Volkov family, Belt origin. Temporary residents, year seventy. Status: Integrating appropriately.

Patience-VII felt satisfaction. They'd provided shelter to those in need, exactly as promised. That the shelter had transformed its guests was simply time doing what time did—changing everything, patiently, inevitably.

The Belt refugees had become Luna citizens, temporarily. In another century or two, they'd forget they were ever anything else. The station would remember, of course. Patient as stone, keeping records of all its temporary guests—some staying a heartbeat, some forever.

Both durations were welcome. Both were, in the end, just moments in Luna's endless now.
