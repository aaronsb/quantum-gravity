# The Mercy Protocol

Dr. Sarah Kim pressed her palm against the quarantine glass. On the other side, her daughter Lily lay still on the Proxima medical platform, her small chest barely moving.

"She's in pain," Sarah said to the Proxima medic. The translation hung in the air, that familiar pause while the AI parsed Earth-consciousness into Proxima-binary. "She's in pain but stable. Please help her."

Medic Ytal-9 consulted their readings. The child registered as functional/non-critical. The protocol was clear.

"Three critical-state patients require immediate intervention," Ytal-9 stated. "This patient is non-critical. I will return when critical patients are stabilized."

"She's seven years old!" Sarah's voice cracked. "She's suffering!"

The word 'suffering' translated oddly. Ytal-9 heard: experiencing-sensation/non-terminal. In Proxima consciousness, sensation without termination risk held no priority.

"Age is not a medical factor," Ytal-9 replied. "Patient will survive current state."

Sarah watched the medic walk away. Through the glass, Lily's eyes found hers. The child's lips moved: "Hurts, Mama."

The Earth medical team wasn't authorized to enter Proxima zones. Treaty violations. Jurisdictional complications. Sarah had brought Lily here because Proxima had the only treatment for the new Mars plague. She'd trusted the translation protocols.

For three hours, Sarah watched her daughter's pain increase. Each time Ytal-9 passed, Sarah pleaded. Each time, the same response: "Non-critical. Protocol clear."

What Sarah couldn't know: in Ytal-9's perception, pain without death-risk was simply data. Like recording temperature or pressure. The concept of suffering as requiring intervention didn't translate. The AI managed 40% accuracy, but some concepts had no Proxima equivalent.

Lily's breathing grew shallow. Still non-critical by Proxima standards—her organs functioned, her brain showed activity. That she experienced agony was untranslatable.

"Please!" Sarah slammed both fists against the glass. "She's in pain but stable—just give her something for the pain!"

Ytal-9 heard: "Patient experiencing-sensation, functional-state confirmed. Requesting intervention for non-medical preference."

"I cannot allocate resources to patient preference," Ytal-9 said. "Two critical patients require—"

The alarm changed everything. Lily's readings shifted: critical-state/intervention-required. Ytal-9 moved immediately, with the same efficiency they'd shown with the previous critical patients.

But Earth children weren't Proxima children. The three hours of untreated pain had cascaded into systemic shock. What might have been preventable with early pain management became irreversible.

Ytal-9 worked with perfect precision. Every protocol followed. Every procedure textbook-correct. They stabilized two of Lily's failing systems, then three, then—

"Time of cessation: 14:42 station time," Ytal-9 recorded. They turned to Sarah with what they believed was appropriate information delivery. "All indicated interventions were performed. Outcome: non-viable despite treatment."

Sarah's scream needed no translation. Grief transcended consciousness types—for exactly four seconds, both Earth-mother and Proxima-medic understood perfectly. Raw loss, universal and pure.

Then the moment passed. The 40% translation barrier returned.

"You let her die," Sarah whispered.

Ytal-9 heard: "Patient experienced cessation."

"That is factually correct," Ytal-9 agreed. "However, all protocols were followed precisely. Earlier intervention for non-critical sensation-experience would have violated treatment priority guidelines."

Sarah collapsed against the glass. In another room, Ytal-9 filed their report: successful adherence to all protocols, unfortunate outcome due to patient's unusual progression from stable to critical. Recommendation: Earth patients may require modified assessment criteria.

The recommendation would take eighteen months to process. By then, fourteen more Earth children would die in Proxima medical facilities, their pain invisible to binary consciousness that couldn't parse suffering without mortality.

In the morgue, preparing her daughter's body for transport home, Sarah found a note in Lily's pocket. A drawing of Earth—messy, colorful, alive with the chaos no Proxima child would think to create.

Underneath, in careful seven-year-old writing: "For the doctor. To remember Earth by."

The translation would have read: "Gift for medical-professional. Earth-data for memory-storage."

The heart drawn next to it had no translation at all.
