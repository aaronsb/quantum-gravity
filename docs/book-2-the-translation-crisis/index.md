**Timeline**: 2125-2175  
**New Worlds**: Proxima b, Belt Colonies  
**Central Theme**: When understanding fails, what remains?

## Overview

Fifty years after Book 1's recognition of consciousness drift, humanity faces the breakdown of translation itself. The 73.2% accuracy that once seemed manageable collapses to ~40%, creating an existential crisis just when cooperation is most needed.

## Core Concept

Book 2 explores what happens when the illusion of understanding finally breaks. It's not about solving the consciousness divergence but learning to love, trade, and survive despite fundamental incomprehension. The story reveals that connection doesn't require understanding - and that every consciousness format, even the most limiting, has its moment of being necessary.

## New Elements

- **Proxima b**: Binary consciousness - no gradients, only absolutes
- **Belt Colonies**: Transient consciousness - no permanence or long-term planning
- **The Nowhere Generation**: Children born between worlds, belonging to none
- **The Translator Collective**: Humans who sacrifice belonging to serve as bridges
- **Translation Collapse**: From 73.2% to ~40% accuracy over 50 years
