# Temporary Shelter

Kass chen-Volkov pressed her face against the viewport, watching Luna Station grow larger. Behind her, three generations of Belt-born family huddled with their possessions—everything that mattered packed into magnetic containers that could move at a moment's notice.

"Temporary shelter," she whispered to her daughter Ava. "Just until the next rock comes through with good ice."

The application had been simple. Luna Station maintained humanitarian protocols—any human in distress could request temporary sanctuary. The Kass family's asteroid had destabilized. Not their fault. Orbital mechanics. They needed a place to wait for the next suitable home.

Curator Patience-VII received them in the docking bay. Luna-born, Luna-bred, they moved with the geological patience of their world. Each gesture took minutes to complete.

"Welcome," Patience-VII said, the word stretching like taffy. "Your temporary stay has been approved."

Kass heard: Brief pause in your journey, shelter for now.

The AI translation managed 32% accuracy between Belt-transient and Luna-eternal consciousness. Neither side realized how much was already lost.

"We appreciate this," Kass said quickly, Belt-fashion. "We'll be gone as soon as—"

"Time," Patience-VII interrupted with lunar slowness, "is not a concern here."

They assigned the family quarters in Section C. Real walls. Real floors. Kass's mother, Dey chen-Volkov, touched the permanent structures with wonder and revulsion.

"It doesn't move," she said.

"Temporary," Kass reminded her. "Everything's temporary."

The first year passed quickly for the Belt family. They kept packed, ready to leave when the right asteroid came. They attended Luna Station meetings, always clarifying: "We're temporary residents."

Patience-VII heard: "We are residents-in-transition." In Luna consciousness, everything was in transition. The universe itself was temporary on the right timescale. The family was welcome.

The second year, young Ava started school. "Just until we leave," Kass insisted. But Luna education moved slowly. A single lesson might span months. Ava began to slow down, to match the rhythm.

"She's adapting," the teacher said approvingly.

"She's forgetting how to move!" Kass pulled Ava out of school. But the damage was done—her daughter had tasted permanence.

Year five. Still no suitable asteroid. The family attended another residents' meeting.

"When do you plan to transition?" Patience-VII asked, meaning: In which century will your journey continue?

"Soon," Kass said desperately. "We're temporary. We don't belong here."

The translation garbled. Patience-VII heard: "We belong here temporarily." Everything belonged temporarily in the vast sweep of time. The family seemed to be settling in well.

Year ten. Dey chen-Volkov died—the first of their line not to die in motion. They buried her in Luna's eternal soil, and Kass felt something break inside. A permanent grave. An anchor.

"We have to leave," she told her brother Tam. "We're becoming them."

But Tam had taken a job in the crystalline gardens. "Just until—" he said, then stopped. Until when? The words were losing meaning.

Year twenty. Ava, now adult, moved with Luna-slowness. She'd forgotten the Belt-ready stance, the constant preparation for motion. When alerts sounded, she didn't flinch.

"There's an asteroid," Kass announced at dinner. "Good ice, stable orbit. We leave tomorrow."

Ava looked at her with Luna-patient eyes. "Leave?"

The word hit Kass like decompression. Her daughter had forgotten they were temporary. The permanence had infected her, grown into her bones during those slow Luna years.

Year thirty. Another meeting.

"We need to go," Kass pleaded with Patience-VII. "We've been here too long. Help us leave."

Patience-VII processed this slowly. In their perception, thirty years was barely arrival. The family had just begun settling in. Why this rush to depart?

"You are welcome to stay," they said. "Your temporary residence is approved."

"It's been thirty years!"

"Yes," Patience-VII agreed. "Temporarily."

Year forty. Kass stopped packing. Stopped watching the asteroid reports. Tam's children had never known motion. They played games that lasted months, told stories that took years to complete.

Year fifty. An old friend visited from the Belt, took one look at Kass's family, and left quickly. "You're not Belt anymore," he said. "You're not anything."

Kass wanted to argue, but the words came too slowly. Fifty years of Luna had changed her syntax, her rhythm. She was caught between—too permanent for the Belt, too transient for Luna.

She found Ava in the observation deck, teaching her son about patience. The boy sat still for hours, learning Luna-ways.

"We were supposed to be temporary," Kass whispered.

Ava turned slowly, smiled with geological peace. "We are, Mama. Everything is."

The resonance spike hit then—for three seconds, Kass felt her daughter's joy. Pure contentment of belonging, of being home. The child between them laughed, and every consciousness type in the station understood that sound.

Then it faded. Kass stood with her Luna-slow daughter and Luna-born grandson, temporary residents in their fiftieth year, waiting for an asteroid that no longer mattered.

Through the viewport, rocks tumbled by in their ancient dance. Temporary homes for temporary people, unless you stayed still too long and grew roots in someone else's eternity.

"When—" Kass began, but couldn't finish. When was a Belt word. Luna only had now, stretched infinite and patient.

Her grandson tugged her sleeve with the slowness of continents.

"Tell me," he said in Luna-time, "about the moving places."

Kass sat, feeling her bones settle into Luna's permanence. Somewhere in the records, their status still read: Temporary Residents. Fifty years and counting.

"Once," she began, and the word took forever, "everything we owned could fly."
