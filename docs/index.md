# Gravity Wells and Consciousness

A literary science fiction series exploring how gravity affects consciousness evolution across human colonies.

## The Beautiful Failure

The first book in the series follows three families across Earth, Mars, and Luna between 2095-2125. What begins as simple translation errors in their messages home gradually becomes something strangerâ€”a growing sense that understanding itself is shifting, that the space between worlds means more than distance.

## About the Series

These are human stories set against the backdrop of humanity's expansion into the solar system. Stories about love, family, and connection when connection itself becomes uncertain. About what remains when the very nature of understanding begins to drift.
