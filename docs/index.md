# Gravity Wells and Consciousness

A literary science fiction series exploring how gravity affects consciousness evolution across human colonies.

## The Beautiful Failure

The first book in the series follows humanity's drift into incomprehension as different worlds develop fundamentally different ways of thinking. Set between 2095-2125, it tracks 2-3 families across Earth, Mars, and Luna as they slowly realize that communication itself is breaking down - not through conflict or technology failure, but through the subtle influence of gravity on neural development.

## Core Premise

Gravity subtly influences quantum processes in neural tissue, creating fundamentally different ways of thinking that diverge over generations. Each world develops its own "consciousness format" - not just culture or personality, but the actual mechanics of how awareness processes reality.
