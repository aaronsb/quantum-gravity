<h1 id="choosing-mars">Choosing Mars</h1>
<p>Priya Patel had been living between frequencies since she was twelve.</p>
<p>That was when her parents—her English father teaching at Mumbai University, her Indian mother running a cross-cultural education nonprofit—first sent her to the Luna Conservatory summer program. Eight weeks of circular composition theory taught by musicians who experienced time as a single note held forever. She'd returned to Earth disoriented, her internal metronome skipping beats, her mother's Mumbai-quick questions feeling like assault. The next summer, they'd sent her to Mars to stay with Dev, where she learned that silence could be an instrument, that absence had its own notation. She'd written her first real composition there: "Spaces Between Sounds," performed to an audience of seven in a dust-sealed dome.</p>
<p>By eighteen, she'd studied at conservatories on three worlds, won competitions on none. Earth judges found her work "too sparse." Mars critics said it "overcrowded the silence." Luna reviewers couldn't understand why her circles had edges. But a small underground of between-world artists had started following her work—other consciousness refugees making art in the gaps.</p>
<p>Her parents had tried to understand. Her mother, Nandini, who'd left Mumbai's chaos for Manchester's different chaos, who'd married her father in defiance of gravity itself. Her father, James, who taught Victorian literature to mining engineers, who'd learned three languages to court her mother, who still couldn't pronounce "consciousness divergence" without making it sound like a disease. They'd given their children names that worked in any accent, any gravity. They'd tried so hard to be citizens of everywhere that they'd ended up citizens of nowhere.</p>
<p>Now Priya stood in the medical center's white room, looking at three pills in her palm: red for Mars, gray for Luna, and blue for Earth.</p>
<p>"It's not a pill," Dr. Morrison explained again, her voice calibrated to Earth-neutral. "It's a neural stabilizer. Helps your consciousness settle into its natural resonance without interference from—"</p>
<p>"I know what it is." Priya closed her fist around the choices. "I've done the research."</p>
<p>She had. Six months of research since her twentieth birthday, conducted in the medical center's archive that smelled of recycled air and difficult decisions. The stabilization clinic occupied the top floor of the Singapore Spaceport Medical Complex—international waters, neutral gravity, designed for transitions. The walls were painted the exact color of no color. The chairs adjusted automatically to support bodies from any world. Even the air pressure split the difference—not quite Earth, not quite Mars, certainly not Luna. A place for choosing who you'd be.</p>
<p>The pills felt heavier than their chemistry warranted. Each one contained a cocktail of neural modulators that would, over the course of seven days, lock her brain into a specific consciousness pattern. Irreversible. Permanent. The age when consciousness became fixed, when the choice became permanent. When you stopped being everyone's child and became one world's adult.</p>
<p>"Your parents?"</p>
<p>"Dad wants Earth. Mom wants 'whatever makes me happy.'" Priya laughed, short and sharp. "Dev chose Mars five years ago. They want one kid they can understand."</p>
<p>"And you? What do you want?"</p>
<p>That was the question that shifted with her location—Earth-quick desires when she was home, Mars-slow certainties when she visited Dev, Luna-patient perspective when she'd gone to see Magnus, though she tried not to think about him yet.</p>
<p>"I dream in red," she said. "Have since I was fifteen. But when I'm awake, I think in Earth patterns. Except when I'm composing—then I think in circles. Luna circles."</p>
<p>The dreams had started during her Mars summer. Not nightmares—just everything tinted rust-colored, moving at speeds that felt both too fast and too slow. She'd wake up gasping Earth-quick breaths in Mars-thin air, her teenage body confused about which gravity to expect. Dev had found her once, sitting outside at dawn, trying to compose the color into sound.</p>
<p>Dr. Morrison nodded. She'd heard variations of this before. The between-generation, caught in gravitational tides. "You compose?"</p>
<p>"Music. Or what I call music. Earth audiences hear chaos. Mars audiences hear too much presence. Luna..." She paused, remembering her last performance at the Tycho Crater amphitheater, how the audience had swayed to rhythms she hadn't intended, finding patterns her Earth-trained mind couldn't perceive. "Luna understands, but says I'm rushing."</p>
<p>"Show me."</p>
<p>Priya pulled out her phone, played her latest composition. Notes that seemed to argue with themselves, rhythms that started Earth-fast then stretched into Mars-silence then circled back like Luna-time. It was beautiful. It was terrible. It was hers.</p>
<p>"I see," Dr. Morrison said when it ended. "You're already between. The stabilizer will just—"</p>
<p>"Force me to choose a side." Priya opened her hand again. Three pills. Three futures. Three ways of never quite being herself. "What happens if I don't?"</p>
<p>"Without stabilization?" The doctor's face went clinical, the practiced expression of someone who'd delivered this warning hundreds of times. Behind her, the wall displayed brain scans—neural patterns frozen mid-divergence, synapses caught between firing patterns. "Cognitive dissonance. Headaches, certainly. Difficulty maintaining relationships. You'll never fully settle into any consciousness pattern. Never fully belong anywhere."</p>
<p>"But I'll be all of them?"</p>
<p>"No. You'll be none of them. Between-consciousness isn't a stable state. It's a constant translation error."</p>
<p>The words hit Priya like a diagnosis. She thought of the headaches she already had—sharp Earth-pain followed by Mars-dull ache, circled by Luna-vertigo. The way conversations felt like tuning three radios at once, never quite finding a clear signal. Her parents' worried looks when she'd stop mid-sentence, lost between ways of finishing the thought.</p>
<p>Priya thought of Dev, how his messages now came wrapped in silence she couldn't parse. Her Earth friends exhausted her with their urgency, their need for immediate response and resolution.</p>
<p>Then there was Magnus—she'd met him at Mei Chen's exhibition. He was visiting from Luna, studying Earth art to understand his wife better. They'd talked for hours about the space between meanings, about music that lived in gaps, about consciousness as composition rather than choice.</p>
<p>He was forty-three. She was nineteen. On Earth, scandal. On Luna, a conversation between equals. On Mars, irrelevant—age was just accumulated absence.</p>
<p>They hadn't touched. Hadn't even exchanged contacts. But she'd felt something shift, like tectonic plates of consciousness grinding past each other. A frequency between frequencies.</p>
<p>"I need time," Priya said.</p>
<p>"You have one week. After that, the window closes. Your brain solidifies its patterns." Dr. Morrison stood. "Choose wisely. You're choosing who you'll be for the next hundred years."</p>
<p>Priya left with the pills in her pocket. Three futures rattling against each other.</p>
<p>She opened a mediated call to Dev, watching the AI interface bloom in soft blue with the patience of gravity itself.</p>
<p>"Mars relay activated with twenty-three minute baseline delay and consciousness differential at 71%, beginning experiential packaging."</p>
<p>The AI would take her Earth-quick thoughts, her urgency and fear, and repackage them for Dev's Mars-consciousness. Not just translating words but creating an entire sensory context he could process in his own timestream.</p>
<p>"I don't know how to choose," she said to the interface. The AI captured not just her words but her pacing, the way she twisted her ring, the Earth-afternoon light through her window.</p>
<p>"Message packaged. Transmitting."</p>
<p>She made lunch while waiting, as the AI had learned her patterns and knew she needed distraction during delay gaps. When Dev's response arrived, it came as a full experience package containing his voice, the red-rust view from his habitat window, and the particular quality of Mars-silence that wrapped around his words.</p>
<p>"You already have chosen." His voice carried Mars-patience, but the AI added context markers—showing her the long pause before he spoke, the way he'd held the ceramic cup she'd sent him, thinking. "You're just afraid to know it."</p>
<p>The AI offered a translation note: <em>His use of 'afraid' carries different weight on Mars—less judgment, more observation of state.</em></p>
<p>She messaged her Earth friends, whose responses arrived instantly in a barrage of urgency that exhausted her: "Choose Earth!" "Don't leave us!" "Mars is so weird now!"</p>
<p>She sat at her keyboard, trying to compose, but the music kept fracturing—Earth harmonies crashing into Mars spaces while Luna circles tangled the rhythm, creating between-music, translation-error music that was uniquely hers.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, she walked to the spaceport. Not to leave—just to watch. Earth shuttles launching quick and bright. Mars vessels moving with geological patience. Luna ships following perfect arcs.</p>
<p>Singapore Spaceport hummed with transitions. Families saying goodbyes that might last decades. Businesspeople checking watches synced to three different gravities. Children pressed against windows, watching ships rise against the equatorial sky. Priya found a quiet spot in the observation lounge, her reflection in the glass overlaid with ascending lights.</p>
<p>"You're Priya Patel."</p>
<p>She turned. Magnus stood there, waiting for a Luna flight. His wife was with him—Sarah, Earth-quick, Earth-beautiful, holding his hand across consciousness gaps. They looked like what they were: a couple who'd learned to love across impossibility.</p>
<p>"I remember your music," he said. "From the gallery."</p>
<p>Sarah looked between them, Earth-instincts reading undercurrents. But she smiled. "You're the composer? Magnus played me your piece. It's..."</p>
<p>"Untranslatable," Priya finished.</p>
<p>"Yes." Sarah's smile went sad. "Like everything important."</p>
<p>They talked while waiting for their flight. About music, about choice, about the space between worlds. Sarah's hand never left Magnus's, but her eyes held understanding. She knew about loving across gaps. About choosing the space between.</p>
<p>"What will you choose?" Magnus asked as their flight was called.</p>
<p>Priya pulled out the three pills. Looked at them. At Magnus and Sarah—Earth and Luna, loving through mistranslation. At the ships launching toward different gravities.</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said.</p>
<p>But that was a lie.</p>
<p>She knew.</p>
<p>Had known since she'd started composing music that no single world could hold. Since she'd felt comfortable nowhere and everywhere. Since she'd realized her frequency wasn't Mars or Earth or Luna but the interference pattern between them.</p>
<p>After they left, Priya sat in the spaceport café and took out the pills, studying them in her palm. Red. Gray. Blue.</p>
<p>Swallowed all three at once.</p>
<p>The medical center would call it an error. A dangerous mistake. Mixing stabilizers, creating chaos instead of clarity.</p>
<p>The pills dissolved bitter on her tongue—Earth-bitter, Mars-bitter, Luna-bitter, each with its own chemical signature. She'd read the warnings. Mixing stabilizers could cause seizures, psychosis, permanent neural damage. No one had tried it on purpose. No one had wanted to live in the spaces between badly enough to risk their mind.</p>
<p>But as the chemicals hit her bloodstream, Priya felt her consciousness not fragment but crystallize. Into something new. Something between. The café walls seemed to breathe—Earth-rhythm overlaid with Mars-patience wrapped in Luna-circles. Time split into three streams flowing at different speeds. She could feel her neurons firing in patterns the medical texts said were impossible—not choosing between gravities but holding all three in superposition.</p>
<p>She opened her phone. Started composing.</p>
<p>The music that came was impossible. Earth urgency threading through Mars absence. Luna circles that never quite closed. It hurt to create. Hurt to hear. Hurt to be.</p>
<p>But it was hers.</p>
<p>She was twenty years old, and she'd chosen not to choose. Chosen to be the space between frequencies, the standing wave where three consciousnesses met and interfered with each other. The note that existed only in the dissonance.</p>
<p>Dev would understand, in his Mars way. Her parents would worry, in their Earth way. Magnus might hear it someday and recognize a fellow refugee from single consciousness.</p>
<p>But really, she'd chosen for the music. For the compositions that needed all three gravities to exist. For the art that lived in gaps.</p>
<p>The headaches started an hour later.</p>
<p>They would never stop.</p>
<p>She would never care.</p>
